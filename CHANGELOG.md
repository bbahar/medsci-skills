# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Journal profiles for Blood, TRANSFUSION and Vox Sanguinis (`/write-paper` and
  `/find-journal`), built from each journal's author-guidelines and masthead text.
  Each records the details that most often trip a submission: Vox Sanguinis counts
  references and tables inside its word limits, TRANSFUSION's abstract ends in
  DISCUSSION and its title page must carry figure, table and reference counts, and
  Blood requires 1–2 Key Points of at most 140 characters and a Data Sharing
  Statement. Fields the source text did not cover (impact factors, open-access
  terms, two journals' AI policies) are marked
  TODO/VERIFY rather than filled from memory.
- A transfusion-medicine and hemovigilance analysis guide for `/analyze-stats`
  (`references/analysis_guides/transfusion_hemovigilance.md`). It covers naming the
  denominator of a reaction rate (units issued vs transfused vs episodes vs patients),
  exact Poisson intervals and zero-event upper bounds, surveillance-definition changes
  as change points, immortal time and confounding by indication when transfusion is the
  exposure, survivor bias in component-ratio analyses, donor-recipient
  cross-classification in storage-age and donor-attribute studies, the healthy donor
  effect, and screening-schedule-dependent alloimmunization incidence.

### Changed

- `/analyze-stats` SKILL.md drops from ~15,100 to ~7,100 estimated tokens: the
  per-analysis-type rules moved unchanged into four files under
  `references/analysis_specific/`, read after the Phase 2 plan fixes the analysis type.
- `/present-paper` SKILL.md drops from ~13,500 to ~10,500 estimated tokens: the Mode A
  python-pptx build internals moved unchanged to `references/mode_a_build.md`; the
  diagram-edge and font-portability gates stay in SKILL.md.

## [5.27.0] - 2026-09-23

### Added

- Eleven oncology and breast-cancer citation styles: Journal of Clinical Oncology,
  Annals of Oncology, Journal of Breast Cancer, the AACR house style (with Clinical
  Cancer Research dependent on it), The Lancet (with The Lancet Oncology), the
  Elsevier Vancouver house style (with The Breast), Breast Cancer Research and
  Treatment and Clinical Breast Cancer. Every file is an unmodified copy from the
  Citation Style Language project with its `<rights>` element intact, and each
  dependent style's parent ships beside it. The registry also records four journals
  that have no dedicated style, with the fallback each one's own guide specifies.
  Contributed by @dr-jeong.
- Four figure-anatomy exemplars for oncology treatment studies: the waterfall plot
  of best response, the swimmer plot of time on treatment, the spider plot of
  tumour-burden trajectory, and the cumulative incidence function under competing
  risks. Each names the elements the figure must carry and, more usefully, the ways
  it misleads when one is missing — an unmarked new-lesion progression, an absent
  ongoing-status arrow, a relabelled Kaplan-Meier complement. The study-type table
  routes oncology trials to them. Contributed by @dr-jeong.
- Prespecified binary diagnostic-accuracy runs produce full precision tables,
  confusion-matrix PDF/PNG and an execution record in the existing analysis
  manifest. Data/configuration/code/output hashes, exact denominators and read-only
  audit/compare commands expose changed versions without implying study validity.
  An original synthetic demo and independent arithmetic/interval controls run
  within the existing analysis CI step.
- Submission build accepts a declared bundle of final Word/PDF, supplement,
  cover-letter and other files. Existing metadata/manifest outputs record byte
  hashes, pinned render inputs, declared reuse rights and unassessed visual and
  content fidelity. Preflight records executed/skipped checks and bundle binding.
- Claim-fidelity reports include sentence/citation evidence rows and an optional
  Markdown table linking source hashes, retrieval identity, metadata audit context,
  and attributed source comparisons. Existing JSON remains the evidence store;
  changed inputs and unmatched review records stay visible on rerun.

### Fixed

- Three of the new oncology exemplars and their index pointed readers to a response
  table in `analyze-stats` that does not exist; they now describe the table the user
  builds. The cumulative-incidence exemplar's cross-reference to the survival table
  type carried the wrong directory.
- The bundled STARD-AI checklist's header declared a split that its own table
  contradicted: the numbered-item denominator (40) was applied to a row-level
  split, giving 22 unchanged items where the table carries 30 across 48 rows.
  The header now states both denominators, the section heading names the row
  count, and the split reconciles with the published statement's own count of
  new-or-modified items. The reference now also carries the guideline's 2026
  author correction, with a note that it changes no checklist item.
- The diagnostic-accuracy template uses a valid SciPy version lookup, preserves
  a 2-by-2 confusion matrix when a class is absent, and reports zero-denominator
  metrics as undefined rather than zero performance. Importing the template is quiet.
- Submission sync refuses missing-package freeze, frozen/edited output overwrite,
  unregistered-file loss and colliding paths. Malformed metadata fails explicitly;
  staged copies preserve source bytes and cooperating mutations share a lock.
  A required preflight check that exits without running cannot report a safe pass.
- Claim-fidelity output no longer equates an absence of automated findings with
  source support. Citation prefixes and page locators are preserved in the evidence
  inventory. New controls run within the existing validation job.

### Changed

- Skill documentation no longer repeats generic anti-hallucination instructions that
  the surrounding guidance already carries. Contributed by @embed-Rayn.
- The contributing checklist is the source of its own counts; the prose above it no
  longer states a number that can drift from the table.

## [5.26.2] - 2026-09-06

**Hotfix:** shipped PDF identity and presentation overflow checks could report a match or clean result without measuring the relevant evidence.

### Fixed

- Inspect the actual npm tarball and classroom ZIPs against the selected release
  source, including file hashes, existing private-identifier/credential patterns,
  PDF text and binary/Office metadata. Publish the inspected tarball and download
  both channels to compare the delivered payload. Recovery runs record the selected
  tag commit and also verify npm versions that are already published.
- Replace a contextual comment in an npm-shipped synthetic R fixture with neutral
  wording. The test computation and expected result are unchanged.
- Presentation overflow checks now request line coordinates from poppler instead of
  silently treating word-only output as a clean measurement. Real-PDF regression
  tests run in the existing CI step. The Nature/Lancet builder uses readable
  outline/glossary text and native bullets, reserves space for wrapped headings
  and captions, and supports choosing installed fonts without rewriting content.
  Font-check success no longer implies the fonts are installed at the venue.
- Consistency linting no longer reports a single COVID-19 spelling as mixed, splits
  numeric/hyphenated abbreviations into partial tokens, or treats grammatical
  follow-up/follow up and long-term/in the long term pairs as spelling drift.
  Synthetic US/UK normal controls supplement the existing seeded-error challenge.
- PDF rendering now honors frontmatter before wrapper/OS defaults for fonts,
  page geometry, font size, line spacing and link colors. Explicit pandoc overrides
  remain available. Glyph scans support an explicitly selected TTC/OTC face and
  report why font coverage could not be checked; different faces are never combined.
  Synthetic font and pandoc regressions extend the existing render test step.
- Full-text retrieval no longer treats scattered title words or body/reference mentions
  as a title match. Report schema 2 separates download results from advisory first-page
  title/identifier evidence and records the PDF hash; related versions and incomplete
  evidence remain visible for review. Existing retrieval counts and downloaded files are
  preserved. Search and library-sync guidance carries the identity evidence downstream.

## [5.26.1] - 2026-09-05

**Hotfix:** published examples retained manuscript-specific details after the privacy cleanup.

### Fixed

- Complete the privacy cleanup of illustrative cover-letter output and citation-order
  test data and reference-check commentary with synthetic values and neutral prose.
  The expected arithmetic
  and citation-order findings are preserved; no detector behavior changes.
- This patch supersedes v5.26.0. Existing tags and published package versions remain
  unchanged.

## [5.26.0] - 2026-09-05

### Fixed

- Remove local source paths from the bundled DOCX's hidden custom properties.
  The reference renderer now strips CSL and bibliography source metadata after
  citation processing; rendered citations remain intact. The existing asset
  anonymization check also inspects all DOCX XML parts and relationships, including
  custom properties and Windows paths. Repository validation checks tracked DOCX files.
- Extend the existing hashed-identifier check to path and project-slug components.
  Replace private project examples and manuscript-specific anecdotes with generic
  descriptions and synthetic challenge values. Public author attribution stays permitted.
- Cursor project rules no longer embed the installer's local checkout path; writes
  are atomic and preserve file permissions.
- Opt-in CLAUDE.md routing updates use atomic writes, preserve CRLF and permissions,
  follow symlinks without deleting them, and reject malformed or duplicate markers.
  A file without a final newline still gains one; concurrent installers are not locked.
- Correct stale contribution and evaluation inventory counts.

### Added

- Optional task routing with `install.py --claude-project <folder>` or `--claude-user`.
  Both are off by default; `--remove-routing` removes the managed block.
- Presentation guidance for generated illustrations, source attribution, spoken
  notes and bilingual decks.

### Changed

- Explain why plugin installations use namespaced skill commands while direct
  installations use bare names, and document `orchestrate` for broad requests.
- No new manuscript detector or blocking gate is introduced in this release.
  Historical Git objects and previously published package versions are unchanged.

## [5.25.0] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- **`/obsidian-paper-vault` — a folder of PDFs becomes an Obsidian vault.** The reference
  pipeline could sync a Zotero library into literature notes (`/lit-sync`), but not start from the
  PDFs themselves. This skill writes one templated note per paper — frontmatter that Dataview can
  query, an embed link to the source, a summary written from the paper's own text — and, once ten
  notes exist, drafts atomic concept notes for the ideas that recur across three or more of them.

  **Batch notes are written from pre-extracted text, never from PDF paths handed to subagents.**
  A subagent that cannot open a file does not report the failure; it writes the note from training
  data, and the output is fluent, correctly formatted, and wrong in its sample sizes and p-values.
  `scripts/extract_pdfs.py` (PyMuPDF) makes the text the only thing a subagent can read, and an
  acceptance gate spot-checks two values per batch against the source text.

  It shares vault folders with `/lit-sync` and enters them from the opposite end — citekey-named
  notes from bibliographic records, title-named notes from PDFs — so neither skill overwrites the
  other's notes. Korean-structured vaults are supported through
  `references/locale/ko/note_templates.md`, mirroring the `/lit-sync` ko locale, and the skill
  honors whatever folder layout a vault already uses rather than imposing its own.

- **Demo 5 rung 3b — the counterfactual arm, and the panel's second Fatal finding closed by
  measurement.** The review panel was right that the study asserted a cause its design could not
  identify: `CTNormalization` demonstrably treats CT and MRI differently, but that does not show the
  transform *caused* the MRI collapse rather than a CT-trained representation failing to transfer.
  That could not be answered by rewording, so it was answered by running one more arm.

  **Rung 3b changes exactly one thing: the input intensity scale.** Each MRI is affinely mapped so
  its in-body percentile range lands on the CT fingerprint's window, read from the trained
  `plans.json`. The normaliser is not bypassed — it is handed input in the domain it assumes, so on
  MRI it does what it does on CT. Clipping at the ceiling falls from a median of **23.2 % to 0.4 %**.
  Same checkpoint, same folds, same TTA, **no retraining**.

  The arm, its rationale, the rejected alternatives and a **written prediction** were fixed in
  `COUNTERFACTUAL_PLAN.md` before it ran, with the interpretation of each possible outcome fixed in
  advance so the result could not be read whichever way flattered the paper.

  **Median Dice 0.0152 → 0.3016** (95% CI 0.1744–0.4048). Differences in population medians, both
  arms resampled independently: **+0.2864** [+0.1204, +0.4048] against the arm as shipped, and
  **−0.5916** [−0.7259, −0.4674] against external CT. Neither interval crosses zero. Empty
  predictions fell from 20 of 60 to 15.

  **Both mechanisms are real and unequal**: of the −0.944 collapse, roughly **0.29 Dice is the
  preprocessing contract** and roughly **0.59 a representation that does not transfer**. An input
  rescaling alone multiplied median Dice by twenty — for much of the original failure the network
  was not misreading MRI so much as never receiving it — and the residual is equally real, because
  an affine map restores dynamic range and cannot make an MR sequence's tissue contrast agree with
  the ordering a Hounsfield window encodes.

  The manuscript's identification hedge is replaced by that decomposition, which is a **stronger**
  claim than the hedge and a **weaker** one than the draft's original "located the cause". Tables,
  figures, both READMEs, the reproducibility lock (16 artifacts) and the conference deck all carry
  the fourth arm. The panel's other two Fatal findings — rung 3 is a constructed test, and one
  authored example cannot ground general claims — stand as narrowed claims, untouched by this
  result.

- **Demo 5 rung 3c — the second counterfactual, and two routes that agree.** Rung 3b kept the wrong
  normaliser and repaired its input. Rung 3c does the opposite: the original images, with the trained
  `plans.json` copied and **only** `normalization_schemes` patched to `ZScoreNormalization` — what
  nnU-Net *would* have selected had `dataset.json` not declared a collection containing 100 MRI
  volumes to be CT. Every other configuration field is byte-identical and the five fold checkpoints
  are the same files. Pre-specified with its own written prediction before it ran.

  **Median Dice 0.2870** (95% CI 0.1348–0.3546). Against rung 3b: **−0.0146 [−0.2136, +0.1575] — the
  interval spans zero.** Both arms leave the same 15 empty predictions of 60, and their per-case Dice
  correlate at **r = 0.939**: they succeed and fail on the same images rather than trading wins.

  **Two unrelated repairs reaching the same place means the intensity *domain* is the whole of the
  preprocessing story and the *form* of the transform is not.** It also settles the metadata
  question: correcting the mislabelled modality field alone would have reached 0.2870, not 0.8932.

  The prediction ("0.20–0.50, around 0.35, plausibly above 3b") was inside its range and **wrong in
  direction**, and is recorded as such — it lowers the weight the previous arm's on-the-nose
  prediction deserves.

  Because a run's log echoes a hardcoded path rather than proving what it loaded, the plan nnU-Net
  wrote into the arm's own output directory is committed as the evidence
  (`qc/rung3c_plans_used.json`: `["ZScoreNormalization"]`, against 3b's `["CTNormalization"]`).

- **`/preprocess-imaging` `check_normalizer_domain.py` — the demo's finding, promoted to a gate
  (85th detector).** Demo 5 measured what a normaliser-domain mismatch costs: **~0.28 Dice**,
  established by two independent counterfactuals neither of which retrained the model. The toolkit's
  own profiler had already recorded the underlying property *before training* — as a **Minor**, in a
  directory no later step reads. **The gap was routing and severity, not detection**, so the gate
  re-reads an existing `/profile-imaging` profile against the contract that will actually be
  applied, at the moment where ignoring it costs something. Two JSON files in, stdlib only: no
  imaging library, no pixels, no model.

  `NORMALIZER_DOMAIN_MISMATCH` (Major) fires when a contract assuming Hounsfield units meets a split
  with no negative voxel — HU is *defined* by an air floor near −1000, so a cohort that never goes
  negative is not in it, whatever a metadata field claims. `NORMALIZER_SPLIT_DIVERGENCE` (Flag)
  fires when splits inside one cohort disagree about the domain.

  **A third check was written and deleted.** `NORMALIZER_CLIP_DESTRUCTIVE` compared each split's 99th
  percentile against the contract's clip ceiling. Run against the cohorts this repository already
  produces, it fired on **100 % of the CT arm and 100 % of the MSD training set** — the data the plan
  was fit on. Of course it did: a CT volume's p99 is bone, and clipping bone above a soft-tissue
  window is what `CTNormalization` is *for*. Deleted rather than tuned, and the reason is recorded in
  the module docstring and the challenge card so it is not re-invented. This is the repository's
  dominant defect class — a checker that rejects the notation the world actually uses — caught by
  running the new detector on the repository's own correct data before shipping it.

  The contract loader also **refuses** input it cannot parse instead of scoring it as "assumes
  arbitrary" and returning OK; the first version did the latter and returned a green on a file it had
  not understood. Challenge card guards all three: the contract's own domain must come back clean,
  an arbitrary-unit cohort must raise a Major, and an unreadable contract must not succeed.
  **58 skills / 47 guidelines / 85 integrity detectors.**

- **`/meta-analysis` now carries where published radiology SR/MAs actually fail PRISMA 2020, not
  only the checklist.** The 27-item / 42-sub-item instrument has always been in `/check-reporting`;
  what a drafting skill was missing is the empirical prior over it. Park 2022 (Korean J Radiol;
  PMID:35213097) scored 24 published SR/MAs and found **24 of the 42 items reported by fewer than
  80%**. Phase 8 now lists the worst of them with their observed rates, because they are not the
  items a compliance run flags loudest: **item 20a — a per-synthesis summary of the contributing
  studies' characteristics and risk of bias — was reported by 0 of 24**, as were data availability
  (27) and registration (24a–c), and the PRISMA-for-Abstracts eligibility and registration items.
  Certainty of evidence sat at 9%, sensitivity analysis at 28%, per-study risk of bias at 32%.

  Two of those are now handled where the work happens rather than only where it is audited. Phase 7
  states that certainty is rated **per outcome** — five domains resolve differently for an outcome
  pooled from 12 studies than from 3, and one review-level "moderate certainty" sentence answers
  nobody's question. Phase 8 gains a data-availability step that names the artifacts being shared,
  and notes that "available from the corresponding author on reasonable request" no longer
  satisfies item 27.

- **PRISMA 2020 for Abstracts is now a vendored checklist — the twelve items nobody was scoring.**
  `/check-reporting` shipped the 27-item main checklist and, in item 2, a paragraph of PRISMA
  *2009* wording where the 2020 statement says only "see the PRISMA 2020 for Abstracts checklist."
  The abstract instrument was absent, so a systematic review could pass a compliance run at a high
  percentage while its abstract was never assessed at all. In the audit above, **item 3 (eligibility
  criteria) and item 12 (registration) were reported by 0 of 24 abstracts**, and risk-of-bias
  methods by 3 of 23 — these items fail together, because the abstract is written last, to a word
  limit, from whatever template the journal supplied.

  `references/checklists/PRISMA_2020_Abstracts.md` carries all twelve items grouped by abstract
  section, verbatim under the statement's CC BY licence with attribution, plus assessor notes for
  the distinctions that decide a score: item 3 asks what *would have been excluded* and is not
  satisfied by item 7's description of what was included; item 5 wants the named tool, not its
  result; item 9 is a limitation of the **evidence**, where "we searched only English-language
  studies" is a limitation of the review process and belongs to main-text item 23c. Item 2 of the
  main checklist now defers to it as the statement does, the guideline-selection table routes SR/MA
  and DTA-SR to both instruments, and `/meta-analysis` Phase 8 calls for a second `/check-reporting`
  pass over the abstract. Scored with its own denominator throughout — folding twelve items into a
  42-item total is how they stayed invisible. **58 skills / 48 guidelines / 85 integrity
  detectors.**

- **Correlated effect sizes from the same participants are now a named decision in Phase 6.** When
  one study contributes several outcomes, readers, thresholds, or time points to the same
  synthesis, those estimates share patients; pooling them as independent counts the same
  participants twice and narrows every interval in the forest plot. The reference gives the three
  legitimate routes — one pre-specified estimate per study, a multivariate model
  (`metafor::rma.mv` over a block-diagonal V), or robust variance estimation — and requires the
  assumed correlation to be stated and varied, since primary studies almost never report it. DTA
  was already covered by the bivariate/HSROC requirement; nothing else was.

### Added

- **A gate that makes every vendored checklist say what it is and what was checked.**
  `scripts/check_checklist_provenance.py`, wired to CI with a challenge card. It requires four
  declarations per file — **version, source with DOI, licence, and verification status** — and it
  fails a file that claims **"Verified"** without naming what it was compared against. That exact
  shape appeared twice in this audit (`STROBE_MR.md`, `PRISMA_ScR.md`); between them those two files
  were wrong in ten ways under their stamps. **A file that honestly says "not compared" passes** —
  the gate is about honesty, not about having done the work.

  On first run it found **two more bare claims nobody had spotted by hand**: `QUADAS_C.md` and
  `REMARK.md`.

  **What it deliberately does not do.** It never reads the instrument. It cannot: the sources are
  copyrighted and cannot ship here, so CI can never re-derive content. Automating even the *DOIs*
  was tried and abandoned — a Crossref bibliographic query returned a **Who's Who biography** for
  NOS, a **Letter to the Editor** for ROBIS, and a **code listing** for QUADAS-C, all above the
  similarity threshold that looked reasonable. Writing those in would have mass-produced the exact
  defect this audit exists to remove. The gate's scope is the honest one: declarations, not content.

  **Backlog ratchet.** 32 files predate the gate and several need a DOI read off the actual article.
  They are named in a `BACKLOG` set: a file *not* on the list must satisfy every declaration, so new
  files comply from the start; a listed file is reported but does not block. `--audit-backlog` fails
  if an entry has quietly become compliant and was not removed, so the list can only shrink and
  cannot decay into a rubber stamp. It earned its keep immediately — it caught six entries that were
  already compliant when the list was first written.

  The challenge card builds its fixtures at runtime (this repository ships no deliberately
  undeclared checklist) and asserts **exit codes**, including that an empty input directory exits 2
  rather than reporting success. Two of its eight cases are the real defect shapes; against a gate
  without the check they fail.

  **The first draft of this gate rejected four files whose wording was correct** — it demanded the
  word "verified" and broke on markdown emphasis inside `has **not** been compared`. That is this
  repository's dominant historical defect, a checker that accepts only its own preferred notation,
  reproduced by the person auditing it. It now matches against a de-emphasised copy and accepts the
  notation the files actually use. A later draft also fired on an item description reading "when
  groups are **compared**"; a verification *claim* is now the word itself, and ordinary prose is not
  a claim.

  **241 gates** (was 238).

### Changed

- **Six checklists gain a partial verification record — item count checked, item text not — and say
  so in those words.** SWiM (9), CHEERS 2022 (28), CLEAR (58), GATHER (18), REMARK (20) and
  CONSORT 2025 (30) each match the count their own statement gives, confirmed against the PubMed
  Central record.

  **They are not marked verified**, and the header says why: *a matching count is not evidence that
  the items would match*. STARD carried the right count of 30 while omitting two items, collapsing
  three sub-item pairs and inventing a fourth (#483). Recording a count check as verification would
  be the same false stamp this audit spent its whole length removing — the difference is that this
  time the temptation was mine.

### Fixed

- **STARD 2015 was missing two items and had invented a sub-item split.** Extracted from the
  published checklist (Bossuyt et al., *BMJ* 2015;351:h5527, CC BY 4.0) and compared programmatically.
  The statement has **30 items in 34 rows** — items 10, 12, 13 and 21 each split into **a** and **b**.
  The file had 30 rows ending at item 28. It:

  - **invented a split at item 8** (8a/8b, where the statement has one item);
  - **collapsed the a/b pairs at 12, 13 and 21** into single rows;
  - **omitted items 29 and 30 entirely** — where the full study protocol can be accessed, and sources
    of funding with the role of funders.

  The collapsed pairs matter: the a/b halves are separate requirements, describing the index test and
  the reference standard, defining cut-offs, stating blinding, and reporting severity distributions
  **for each side separately**. Collapsed into one row, a study satisfies half an item and scores
  complete. Rebuilt to all 34 rows, asserted against the extracted original.

  **STARD is CC BY**, which breaks the pattern this audit has been reporting for a third time. It is
  neither an extension nor paywalled, and it had a structural defect. The three generalisations
  offered so far — "extensions are the dangerous class", "paywalled sources are", and now anything
  narrower than "any file that was never compared" — have each survived until the sample widened.
  **The only predictor that has held is whether the file was ever checked against its source.**

- **RECORD verified clean, 13/13.** The item set (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 7.1, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3,
  13.1, 19.1, 22.1) matches the statement exactly. A duplicate `Source:` line left by the
  backlog sweep is removed.

- **STROBE now says *why* it is unverified.** The checklist table is not carried in the statement's
  PubMed Central record — it lives in the explanation-and-elaboration paper and on the STROBE website
  — so it could not be compared here. Saying which is more useful to a reader than a bare
  "not verified".

### Changed

- **CONSORT-AI and SPIRIT-AI verified clean — and they correct the pattern this audit had been
  claiming.** Both enumerated from the articles' own checklist tables via PMC XML and compared
  label-by-label. **CONSORT-AI: 14/14** (11 Extensions, 3 Elaborations). **SPIRIT-AI: 15/15**
  (12 Extensions, 3 Elaborations). Nothing missing, nothing invented, labels exact.

  The audit had been reporting that *extension* checklists were the dangerous class — four for four
  at the time. That generalisation does not survive these two. The variable that actually separates
  the good files from the bad is **whether the source could be opened**:

  | Source | Files | Worst defect found |
  |---|---|---|
  | **Open (CC BY)** | TRIPOD+AI, CONSORT-AI, SPIRIT-AI, PRISMA 2020 | wording drift — PRISMA 2020's items 4 and 13b |
  | **Paywalled (JAMA, ACP)** | PRISMA-DTA, STROBE-MR, PRISMA-ScR, PROBAST, QUADAS-2 | **structural** — an instrument that was not the instrument, all 30 sub-items dropped, a renumbered checklist, an invented section |

  Every structural defect came from a file whose source was behind a paywall. Where the table could
  be opened and transcribed, it was transcribed. Where it could not, someone reconstructed it from
  the base instrument or from memory — and that is where invented sections, dropped sub-items and
  closed numbering gaps come from. This predicts the risk in the 35 files not yet audited far better
  than "is it an extension".

  Both files also gain a distinction the statements make and the files did not: an **Extension** is a
  new reporting requirement the base instrument does not contain; an **Elaboration** clarifies how an
  existing base item applies to an AI intervention. Both are assessed, but only Extensions are
  additional obligations — reporting an Elaboration as though CONSORT 2010 or SPIRIT 2013 had been
  silent overstates what the extension added. Elaborations are now marked **(E)**.

### Changed

- **MOOSE verified against the published table — clean, 35/35 — and the backlog shrinks to 31.**
  Read through institutional access (Stroup et al., *JAMA* 2000;283(15):2008-2012). The item set,
  the six groups and their counts (Background 6, Search strategy 10, Methods 8, Results 4,
  Discussion 3, Conclusions 4), and the order all match. Nothing missing, nothing added.

  The file now declares its DOI, its licence position (*JAMA*, no open licence — the descriptions
  are an in-house summary, not the published wording) and what it was verified against, so it
  leaves the provenance gate's backlog. **This is the ratchet doing the job it exists for:** the
  backlog can only shrink, and `--audit-backlog` fails if an entry becomes compliant and is not
  removed.

  MOOSE also sharpens a claim this audit has been making. It is **paywalled and correct**, so
  "paywalled" is not a rule — the honest statement is that **every structural defect found so far
  occurred in a paywalled file, while not every paywalled file is defective**. A risk factor, not a
  law. The audit has now over-generalised twice (first "extensions are the dangerous class", then
  "paywalled sources are"), and both times the correction came from widening the sample rather than
  from reasoning about it.

### Changed

- **Every one of the 48 vendored checklists now declares what it is, where it came from, and whether
  it has been checked. The provenance backlog is zero.**

  31 files were carrying gaps — no DOI, no licence, or silence about verification. Each now states
  all four. The facts were not guessed: **every DOI was resolved through Crossref and confirmed by
  the title it returned**, and every licence is the Crossref `license` URL or the PMC `<license>`
  element. Two candidate DOIs were rejected by that check — one for TARGET returned 404, and one for
  the RoB NMA tool resolved to a paper on Kenward-Roger corrections. Both were replaced with the real
  articles rather than shipped.

  **Three files carried bare "Verified" stamps** — `GATHER.md`, `QUADAS_C.md`, `REMARK.md` — found by
  the gate, not by hand. They now say what was and was not compared.

  **What most of these files now say is "NOT VERIFIED".** 32 of 48 have not been compared against
  their published table, and they say so in the header rather than leaving a reader to assume
  otherwise. That is the point: the gate cannot make a checklist correct, but it can stop one from
  implying it has been checked when it has not.

  Two licence corrections fell out of the sweep:

  - **ROBIS is CC BY 4.0.** `LICENSES.md` recorded "no open licence found" for it in #472; that was
    wrong, and the Crossref record is unambiguous.
  - **PROBAST+AI and ROBINS-E are CC BY-NC 4.0** — non-commercial, and so in the same position as
    ROBINS-I: not redistributable verbatim under this repository's MIT licence. Both are now labelled.

  The gate gains one exception it was always meant to have: **an instrument with no DOI may say so**.
  The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale is distributed from an institute web page and has never been issued one.
  Demanding a DOI unconditionally is how a checker pressures someone into inventing a fact.

### Fixed

- **`PRISMA_ScR.md` had renumbered the instrument, and 10 of its 22 items carried the wrong number.**
  Checked against the statement's table (Tricco et al., *Ann Intern Med* 2018;169(7):467-473).

  PRISMA-ScR keeps PRISMA's **1–27 numbering**. Five rows are marked *"Not applicable for scoping
  reviews"* — **13** (summary measures), **15** and **22** (risk of bias across studies and its
  results counterpart), **16** and **23** (additional analyses and its counterpart) — and two are
  optional, phrased *"If done"*: **12** and **19**, the critical-appraisal pair. That is how
  27 rows come to be described as "20 essential items + 2 optional".

  The file had deleted the five N/A rows and closed the gaps, renumbering everything from 13 onward:

  | Official | This file said |
  |---|---|
  | 14 Synthesis of results (Methods) | 13 |
  | 17 Selection of sources of evidence | 14 |
  | 18 Characteristics of sources | 15 |
  | **19 Critical appraisal within sources** | **16** |
  | 20 Results of individual sources | 17 |
  | 21 Synthesis of results (Results) | 18 |
  | 24 Summary of evidence | 19 |
  | 25 Limitations | 20 |
  | 26 Conclusions | 21 |
  | 27 Funding | 22 |

  Item numbers are how authors, reviewers and editors refer to a checklist. A reviewer asking about
  "PRISMA-ScR item 25" means Limitations; this file had no item 25 and put Limitations at 20. A
  compliance report citing "item 19" from it meant Summary of evidence, where the guideline's item 19
  is the critical-appraisal results.

  Compounding it, the header and the assessor notes named the optional pair as **"12 and 16"**. Item
  16 is *Additional analyses* and is **N/A** — a different item with a different status. An assessor
  following the file would have looked for optional appraisal data under 16 and never scored item 19
  at all.

  Restored to 1–27 with the five N/A rows present and labelled, and the optional pair at 12 and 19 —
  asserted programmatically (`ids == 1..27`, N/A set `[13, 15, 16, 22, 23]`, optional set `[12, 19]`,
  20 essential). The item descriptions, which were sound, are unchanged apart from the numbering and
  the cross-references in the notes. The statement's terminology footnote is now carried: *critical
  appraisal* rather than risk of bias, *sources of evidence* rather than studies, *charting* rather
  than extraction — and why.

  The previous revision carried a "Verified" stamp, as `STROBE_MR.md` did. Neither had been compared
  against the published table.

- **`STROBE_MR.md` cited a non-existent author, cited the wrong paper, dropped all 30 sub-items,
  shifted the last four items by one, invented an item that does not exist — and carried a
  "Verified" stamp.** Checked against the statement (Skrivankova et al., *JAMA*
  2021;326(16):1614-1621).

  - **Citation.** The file credited "Skidmore ME / Davey Smith G, Davies NM, et al. *BMJ*
    2021;375:n2233". There is no such first author, and n2233 is the **Explanation and Elaboration**
    paper, not the statement. The statement is in *JAMA*.
  - **All 30 sub-items were absent.** The file listed items 1–20 only — which is close to a
    re-lettered STROBE. Everything that makes a report a Mendelian-randomization report lives in the
    sub-items: variant measurement, quality control and selection (**4c**), the MR estimator
    (**6c**), preregistration (**9b**), 2-sample similarity and **participant overlap** (**10d**),
    assumption-validity results (**12a/b**), direction of causation (**13c**), and gene-environment
    equivalence (**16b**). None were scoreable.
  - **Items 17–20 were shifted by one**: Funding sat at 17, where the statement has Generalizability;
    Data sharing at 18; conflicts at 19 — and the file **invented an item 20, "Other"**, where the
    statement has Conflicts of interest.
  - **Licence claim wrong**: the statement was described as CC BY. It is *JAMA*, under no open
    licence. (The E&E is a separate BMJ paper.)
  - The assessor notes cited item numbers that do not exist in the instrument ("9c / 12e", "16" for
    ancestry generalisability, which is 17).

  The "Verified" stamp is the part worth dwelling on. A file can assert it was checked and be wrong
  in six ways at once; the stamp is only as good as what was compared, and nothing here had been
  compared against the published table.

  Rebuilt: 20 items and 30 sub-items, asserted programmatically against the official structure,
  section grouping restored, wording in our own words under the JAMA licence position, and the
  relationship to STROBE stated correctly — a stand-alone extension in which every item and sub-item
  was modified **except 6d**. The statement's own instruction that the checklist is **not** an
  instrument for evaluating research quality is now carried.

  **Fifth extension file audited, fifth with a structural defect.** PRISMA-DTA, PROBAST, PRISMA-ScR,
  STROBE-MR — all four of the worst showed the same signature: the base instrument's skeleton with
  the extension's substance dropped, renumbered, or invented.

- **QUADAS-2 verified against the published article, and three things it got wrong are corrected.**
  Read through institutional access (Whiting et al., *Ann Intern Med* 2011;155(8):529-536). The good
  news first: the four domains, the **3 / 2 / 2 / 3 split of the ten signalling questions**, what each
  asks, the answer options, the judgement levels, and the restriction of applicability to the first
  three domains all match. Unlike PROBAST and PRISMA-DTA, nothing here was invented.

  What was wrong:

  - **"No to any signalling question → High risk of bias."** The statement says a No establishes that
    *potential for bias exists*, and the reviewer then applies the review-specific guidance to reach
    the judgement. The file had replaced a judgement with an automatic rule, which over-rates bias and
    removes the step the tool exists to structure.
  - **The four phases were missing entirely** — state the review question, **tailor the tool to the
    review**, draw the study's flow diagram, then judge. Tailoring is not optional in QUADAS-2; the
    tool is meant to be adapted per review with written guidance, piloted by two people. A file that
    presents ten fixed questions has quietly dropped the phase that makes the rest defensible.
  - **The prohibition on summary quality scores was absent.** The statement is explicit that QUADAS-2
    must not be used to produce one.

  Also added: that Yes is phrased to mean low risk of bias, that Unclear is for insufficient
  reporting rather than difficult judgement, how to report the assessment across studies, and that
  QUADAS-2 does not cover comparisons of multiple index tests — the development group considered it
  and found the evidence base insufficient.

  **Licence.** Still *Annals of Internal Medicine*, still no open licence. The signalling questions
  are now stated as what each asks in our own words, with numbering and structure — which are fact —
  reproduced exactly. Same treatment as `PROBAST.md`.

  The header's fidelity note is upgraded from "has not been compared against the published tool" to
  what was actually checked, and a duplicate `Reference:` line left behind by the previous revision is
  removed.

- **`PRISMA_DTA.md` was not PRISMA-DTA. It was PRISMA 2009, renumbered.** Verified against the
  statement itself (McInnes et al., *JAMA* 2018;319(4):388-396, read through institutional access,
  including its 2020 correction). PRISMA-DTA keeps the count of 27 by **deleting items 15 and 22** and
  **adding items D1 and D2**. The file had:

  - **items 15 and 22 present** — both deleted by the guideline;
  - **D1 and D2 absent** — the two DTA-specific items the extension exists to add. **D1** asks for the
    index test's intended use and clinical role, and the rationale for a minimally acceptable accuracy;
    **D2** asks for the statistical methods used in the meta-analysis. A generic PRISMA checklist
    cannot surface either, which is the whole reason the extension was written;
  - **23 of the 25 shared items worded differently from the published item**, including item 4 asking
    for "PIRD elements" where the statement asks for participants, index test and target conditions,
    and item 2 asking a diagnostic-accuracy review to summarise "interventions".

  Anyone who scored a DTA systematic review with this file scored two items the guideline had removed
  and never scored the two it had introduced.

  Rebuilt. The structure — which items exist, their numbering, section placement and topic labels —
  now matches the statement exactly and is asserted by comparison against the parsed original. The
  **abstract checklist** the statement carries (and to which its item 2 defers) is captured too, with
  its own DTA-specific item A1, and scored with its own denominator like `PRISMA_2020_Abstracts.md`.
  Item 20 reflects the published correction: "receiver operating characteristic **plot**", not "curve".

  **Licence.** *JAMA* publishes this under no open licence — free to read is not free to reuse. The
  descriptions are an in-house summary of what each item asks, in our own words; the longest run of
  the published wording that survives anywhere in the file is eleven words of unavoidable terminology.
  Structure is fact and is reproduced exactly; expression is ours.

  Assessor notes name the two failure modes this file used to cause: scoring items 15 and 22, and
  missing the unit-of-assessment requirement in item 13 (per patient vs per lesion), which changes
  what every downstream accuracy estimate means.

- **Five checklist licence claims were wrong, and one of them conflicts with this repository's own
  licence.** `LICENSES.md` presented itself as the attribution record for the bundled checklists and
  asserted **CC BY** for ROBINS-I, RoB 2, QUADAS-2, PROBAST and PRISMA-DTA. Every entry was resolved
  against the article DOI through the Crossref `license` field and, where Crossref carried only a
  text-and-data-mining policy, the PubMed Central `<license>` element:

  | Instrument | Claimed | Actually |
  |---|---|---|
  | **ROBINS-I** (BMJ 2016) | CC BY | **CC BY-NC 3.0** — non-commercial |
  | RoB 2 (BMJ 2019) | CC BY | no CC licence found (BMJ TDM policy only) |
  | QUADAS-2 (Ann Intern Med 2011) | CC BY | © ACP, no open licence |
  | PROBAST (Ann Intern Med 2019) | CC BY | © ACP, no open licence |
  | PRISMA-DTA (JAMA 2018) | CC BY | © AMA, no licence field |

  The ROBINS-I row is the one that bites: **NC is incompatible with redistributing a verbatim
  reproduction under this repository's MIT licence**, and the toolkit ships through npm, GitHub and a
  classroom ZIP without restriction. The claim had been inherited rather than checked.

  Eight rows were confirmed correct on the same evidence — STROBE, STARD, TRIPOD+AI, PRISMA 2020 and
  its abstract checklist, CONSORT 2025, SPIRIT 2025 (all CC BY 4.0) and ARRIVE 2.0 (CC0 1.0) — so the
  table is now split by verified status rather than presented as uniform, and it states the method
  so the next person can re-run it. Files whose licence has not been resolved are named as
  unresolved: an absent licence statement is not evidence of permissive licensing.

- **`RoB2.md`, `ROBINS_I.md` and `QUADAS2.md` now say what they are.** All three carried a bare
  `Reference:` line — no version, no licence, no statement of fidelity — while reading as though they
  reproduced the instruments. Each now carries the full citation with DOI, the verified licence
  status, and an explicit statement that it is an in-house summary of the tool's **structure**
  (domains, answer options, judgement levels) which has not been compared against the official
  document, with a direction to complete the official form for anything reported.

  Their content is deliberately left alone. Rewriting signalling questions without the official
  source in hand is precisely how the wrong text arrived in these files, and the sources are
  subscription-access. What could be checked was checked: ROBINS-I's seven domains, their order and
  the Low / Moderate / Serious / Critical scale match the article.

  `ROBINS_I.md` also records that **ROBINS-I V2 exists and is still in draft** (revised November
  2025), adding algorithms from signalling questions to domain judgements and covering immortal-time
  bias, which the 2016 version omits. A reader appraising against the 2016 tool should know a
  successor is in progress.

- **`PROBAST.md` presented four invented bullets as the AI extension, and dropped three assessment
  criteria from the official signalling questions.** Audited against the published statement
  (Wolff et al., *Ann Intern Med* 2019;170:51-58). The domain structure and the count are right —
  20 signalling questions, 2 / 3 / 6 / 9 across the four domains — but:

  - A section headed **"PROBAST+AI Extensions (2024)"** listed four bullets ("Data: training/
    validation/test split…", "Model: architecture transparency…") that appear nowhere in any
    version of the tool. PROBAST+AI is a real instrument with 16 development and 18 evaluation
    signalling questions, it is dated **2025** not 2024, and this repository already vendors it
    correctly as `PROBAST_AI.md`. An assessor following that section was appraising against
    something a maintainer made up.
  - **4.8 dropped "underfitting"** — the official question asks about overfitting, underfitting
    *and* optimism.
  - **4.6 dropped its examples** — censoring, competing risks, and sampling of control participants
    are what make that question assessable.
  - 3.6 dropped "determination" (the interval runs to when the outcome was *determined*), and 4.9
    dropped "results from the".

  All restored, and the AI section replaced by a pointer to `PROBAST_AI.md` with the correct
  citation. The file also now records that **PROBAST 2019 is superseded by PROBAST+AI 2025** for new
  assessments, which the tool's own authors state and this file did not.

  **Licence.** PROBAST is published in *Annals of Internal Medicine* (© American College of
  Physicians) under **no open licence**, and this file had been reproducing its signalling questions
  near-verbatim with no licence statement. The questions are now an **in-house summary of what each
  asks**, labelled as such, with the numbering and structure (which are facts, not expression)
  verified against the statement, and a direction to complete the official tool for anything
  reported. This is the first file where the audit's two risks pointed in opposite directions:
  diverging from the original makes the instrument wrong, and matching it too closely makes it a
  reproduction we have no licence for.

- **`TRIPOD_AI.md` verified clean — 52/52 against the official supplements.** Compared
  character-for-character against ST1 (expanded checklist) and ST2 (fillable checklist); every
  sub-item matches and the D/E designations match the statement exactly. Five orthographic
  differences were normalised to the published wording (an added "the" in items 2 and 5a, hyphenation
  in 12c and 22, and British spellings of "generalizability" in 26 and 27c). Two official footnotes
  that qualify how items are scored were not being carried and now are: item 12c is assessed
  **separately for each model-building approach**, and 18f (analysis code) is a different question
  from 22 (code to implement the model for a new individual). The header records what it was verified
  against, so the next person does not have to redo it to find out.

  This file was already the best of the ones audited so far — it carried a citation, a DOI, a
  licence line, a correct 27-item/52-sub-item count, and an explicit "NOT official items" fence
  around the toolkit's own supplemental checks. That is the shape the rest should be brought to.

- **Four items in the vendored PRISMA 2020 checklist did not match the published checklist, and two
  of them would have changed a score.** The file carried a bare `Source:` URL, no DOI, no licence
  line and no statement of how faithful it was, and it had never been compared against the official
  checklist. Run character-for-character against the official PDF, 42 of 42 sub-items present, five
  cells divergent:

  | Item | This file said | The statement says |
  |---|---|---|
  | **4** | "…the review addresses **using the PICO framework or similar**" | "…the review addresses." — PICO is PRISMA **2009** wording |
  | **13b** | "…such as handling of **multi-arm studies and multiple outcome measures**" | "…such as handling of **missing summary statistics, or data conversions**" |
  | 16a | reordered, "PRISMA flow diagram" | "…ideally using a flow diagram" |
  | 19 | "structured tables or **forest** plots" | "structured tables or plots" |
  | 2 | an editorial gloss appended in-cell | "See the PRISMA 2020 for Abstracts checklist." |

  Items 4 and 13b are not cosmetic. A reviewer scoring against item 4 would mark down a manuscript
  that states its objectives without a PICO frame, which the guideline does not ask for; item 13b
  sent an assessor looking for multi-arm handling when the item is about missing summary statistics
  and data conversions. All five are restored to the official wording, and the 42/42 verbatim
  comparison now runs clean. The file gains a full citation, DOI, CC BY licence line, and a fidelity
  statement; editorial comment moved out of the item cells into *Notes for Assessors*, because an
  assessor must read the guideline's words rather than ours.

- **`PRISMA_DTA.md` carries a warning: one item is known wrong and the rest are unverified.** Its
  item 2 asks a *diagnostic test accuracy* review to summarise **"interventions"** — the same
  PRISMA 2009 inheritance, never adapted. The published checklist is in JAMA and was not available
  to run the comparison, so the remaining items are neither confirmed nor corrected. The file now
  says so at the top and tells the reader to complete the official checklist for anything they
  submit, rather than presenting itself as submission-ready.

  This is a first result, not a survey: **one of 48 vendored checklists has been audited.** The
  audited one was in the better-documented tier — it had a source line and a LICENSES row — and it
  still carried four divergences. Twelve files carry no provenance at all, thirty-five carry no
  licence statement, and fifteen declare themselves faithful in-house summaries rather than
  reproductions, which leaves thirty-three reading as verbatim without saying so.

- **`/meta-analysis` handed every binary outcome the one specification Cochrane says to avoid for
  rare events.** `references/phase6_statistical_synthesis.md` prescribed
  `method = "Inverse"`, `method.tau = "DL"`, `incr = 0.5` unconditionally, and told the reader in
  as many words to prefer `"Inverse"` over `"MH"` — a choice made to dodge a `method.tau` conflict,
  not for any property of the data. Inverse-variance weights rest on a large-sample normal
  approximation that fails with few events, and adding 0.5 to every cell biases the estimate toward
  the null and distorts its variance. Cochrane Handbook §10.4.4.1, restated for radiology SR/MA in
  Park 2022 (PMID:35213097): inverse-variance methods **including DerSimonian-Laird** are to be
  avoided in meta-analyses of rare events.

  The default is now conditional. A pooled event rate below 1%, or any zero-event arm, branches
  onto Peto, Mantel-Haenszel **without** a zero-cell correction, or a binomial-normal GLMM, each
  with runnable `metabin` calls and the trade-off that decides between them — Peto's advantage
  disappears under unbalanced arms or a large effect, which is precisely when it gets reached for.
  The reference also warns against the way the branch is most easily undone: Peto and MH are
  fixed-effect estimators, and `meta` builds their random-effects companions by inverse-variance
  weighting with τ² added, restoring the weighting the branch existed to escape. Modelling
  heterogeneity in a rare-event pool is what the GLMM is for. Handling of double-zero studies and
  the alternative specification as a sensitivity analysis are now required in the write-up. The
  interesting part is that none of this was visible to any gate in the repository: the code was
  valid R, it converged, and it produced a number.

- **The rationale for the synthesis model was nowhere in the skill, and it is the rationale
  reviewers reject.** PRISMA item 13d asks *why* a model was chosen and was reported by 35% of the
  scored papers — but the common failure is a stated reason of the wrong kind. Fixed versus random
  effects is a judgment about whether the studies estimate one identical true effect; Cochran's Q
  and I² describe scatter and cannot answer it, Q being underpowered at small k. Phase 6 now names
  the forbidden phrasings ("a random-effects model was used because I² was 65%") against a worked
  replacement that locates the reason in the studies — scanner platform, reader experience,
  positivity threshold — and sets random effects as the radiology default, since a fixed-effect
  primary there needs an argument rather than a p-value.

- **The submission tag gate printed `PASS ... tag-clean` on a package carrying live `TODO` and
  `FIXME`, and which answer you got depended on whether ripgrep was installed.**
  `scripts/tag_cleanup_gate.sh` has two scan backends. The `grep -r` fallback reads every file
  under the scaffold directories; the ripgrep branch honoured `.gitignore`/`.ignore` and skipped
  dotfiles. So a draft tag sitting in an ignored `build/` directory, or in a hidden working note,
  was invisible to one backend and caught by the other — and the blind backend was the one that
  exits 0. Reproduced end to end: a package with `FIXME` in `7_Manuscript/.draft_note.md` and a
  `TODO` in an ignored `7_Manuscript/build/generated.md` returned
  `PASS: 0 hits. Submission package is tag-clean.` The rg branch now passes `--no-ignore --hidden`,
  restoring parity.

  The same PASS sentence carried a quieter overclaim. The scan covers only whichever of the six
  scaffold directories exist, yet it spoke for "the submission package" — a project laid out under
  different names would have received a clean bill of health from a scan that read nothing of it.
  It now names the directories it read and, when any declared directory is absent, says so and
  states that the result does not cover the tree.

  `tests/test_tag_cleanup_gate.sh` is new and CI-wired: the gate previously shipped with **no test
  at all**. It builds its fixtures at runtime (so this repository ships no live draft tags of its
  own), runs the gate under both backends, and asserts the property that actually matters — the two
  reach the **same verdict on the same tree**. Against the pre-fix script it fails 8 of its 16
  checks. The exclusion globs and the `DI-8:ignore-file` opt-out are asserted under both backends,
  so the widened scan cannot quietly break them.

- **The panel diversity gate told the editor that the panel's only independent reviewer had added
  nothing.** `LENS_COLLAPSE` (`skills/self-review/scripts/check_panel_diversity.py`) fires when one
  reviewer's concern families are all covered by others — reasonable evidence of a redundant
  assignment when that reviewer shares the generator's model substrate, and close to backwards when
  it does not. Cross-substrate agreement is corroboration, and that reviewer is the very lens
  `SUBSTRATE_MONOCULTURE` (in the same file) requires the panel to contain. It fired for real on a
  panel containing a Codex reviewer, recommending the editor reconsider the one thing making the
  review independent.

  `LENS_COLLAPSE` is now exempt when the roster declares a reviewer on a different substrate from
  the generator, and the exemption is **recorded** in `summary.lens_collapse_substrate_exempt` and
  printed — a skipped check that prints nothing is indistinguishable from a check that passed.
  Gated on both substrates being declared, so a roster without substrate fields behaves exactly as
  before. Three regression cases were added, including one asserting the check **still fires** on a
  same-substrate redundant lens, so the exemption cannot be satisfied by deleting the check.
- **Demo 5's headline decomposition named a denominator its two components do not add up to.** Six
  shipped documents said, in one wording or another, *"of the −0.944 collapse, roughly 0.29 Dice is
  the preprocessing contract and roughly 0.59 a representation that does not transfer"* — and
  0.29 + 0.59 = 0.88, not 0.944. Re-derived from the shipped per-case CSVs, the two terms are
  **+0.2864** and **+0.5916**, and they sum to **0.8780** — the external-CT-to-MRI gap
  (0.8932 → 0.0152). (0.878073 unrounded; every figure here is quoted so that the displayed numbers
  reproduce the displayed total, which is the discipline this entry exists to restore.) The −0.9443
  they were attributed to is measured against the *internal* arm
  and additionally carries the internal-to-external CT drop of **0.0662** — a same-modality cohort
  shift the repository reports separately, with an interval excluding zero, and which the modality
  decomposition has no claim on. The denominator is now the gap the two terms actually explain, with
  the omitted term named. Any reader who added the two numbers would have found the 0.07 in about
  five seconds, and this is the demo whose argument is that a plausible-looking number can be wrong.

  The exact closure is a **diagnostic, not a result**, and the corrected prose now says so. Any arm
  placed between two others partitions the interval between them exactly — `(3b−3) + (2−3b) ≡ (2−3)`
  holds whatever 3b scores — so "the two account for the gap in full" would have dressed an identity
  as a finding. What the counterfactual actually buys is the **position** of the split: 0.29 / 0.59
  rather than any other partition of the same 0.878. The closure earned its place only as the check
  that exposed the wrong denominator.

  Two smaller defects in the same passage. `README.md` rounded 0.2864 and 0.5916 to **~0.28 and
  ~0.60** where every other document rounded them to 0.29 and 0.59; both directions were wrong at two
  decimal places, and one result now ships as one pair of numbers. And `README.md` asserted flatly
  that *"Both predictions were written before their runs"*, which `CASE_STUDY.md` in the same
  directory explicitly declines to claim: *"this repository cannot prove that ordering — the plan and
  the rung-3 results first appear in the same commit."* The summary asserted what its own detail
  disclaims; the README now carries the caveat and points at it.

  Corrected in `README.md`, `CASE_STUDY.md`, `COUNTERFACTUAL_PLAN.md`, `manuscript/writeup.md` (two
  passages) and the talk. `qc/self_review.md` records what that review concluded at the time and is
  left standing, with a bracketed correction rather than a rewrite. The deck was **rebuilt** from
  `presentation/build_deck.py` — editing the generator and shipping the old `.pptx` is the failure
  this repository has logged before — and the rebuilt file was re-read to confirm it carries the new
  figure; both deck gates pass.

- **The demo reproducibility-lock CI step stopped at demo 3, and a stale lock had already reached
  main.** `demo/04_pneumoniamnist_cnn/manifest.lock.json` did not verify: its
  `qc/reference_audit.json` was edited after the lock was built (an absolute path scrubbed out), so
  the recorded hash no longer matched the file. Nothing caught it, because the CI loop covered
  demos 1–3 only — the lock existed, was committed, and was never checked. That is precisely the
  drift a content-hash lock exists to detect, sitting undetected inside the mechanism meant to
  detect it.

  The lock is rebuilt and the loop now covers **all five demos**. Verified in both directions:
  every demo verifies clean, and perturbing one byte of a locked file makes the gate fail.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Demo 5 — MSD to AMOS spleen ladder** (`demo/05_msd_amos_spleen/`). The fifth live demo, and the
  first that leaves a laptop: nnU-Net v2 trained on MSD Task09 and evaluated on three labelled rungs
  (internal held-out n=9, genuinely external AMOS **CT** n=300, and AMOS **MRI** n=60 as a modality
  shift). Median Dice **0.9595 → 0.8932 → 0.0152**. Every number comes from an executed run, and the
  evaluation plan — including a written prediction for the MRI rung — was fixed before any prediction
  existed and ships unedited.

  It is also the first demo whose headline is a **failure**. The MRI collapse is not the network
  failing to generalise: the trained `plans.json` carries `CTNormalization` into inference and
  `nnUNetv2_predict` has no argument that declares the incoming modality, so a Hounsfield-unit clip
  (`[-38, 174]`) is applied to arbitrary-unit images. Replaying that contract over **both** external
  arms measures it — **0 of 60** MRI cases contain a negative voxel against **300 of 300** on CT, and
  a median **23.2%** of voxels are flattened at the clip ceiling against **2.7%** — while the run
  still exits 0 and writes 60 plausible contours. Without ground truth it is silent. The control arm
  is what makes that a measurement instead of an anecdote.

  The uncomfortable part is that **`/profile-imaging` already caught it, and filed it as a Minor**.
  Before any training it returned `INTENSITY_SCALE_INCONSISTENT` — "500/600 cases bottom out near air
  and the rest do not, mixed modality, or a rescale not applied to part of the cohort" — naming the
  exact property that later broke the MRI rung, and that claim sat in the study's `qc/` directory for
  nine days. So the gap the demo documents is **not detection**: it is **routing and severity**.
  Nothing carries a profiling-stage claim to the inference stage, nothing compares a trained plan's
  assumed intensity domain against the arm about to be predicted, and a finding worth a Dice of 0.015
  ranked below the level at which anyone stops. A gate that fires into a directory no later step
  reads is, operationally, a gate that did not fire. No new detector is added here; the finding is
  recorded so the fix can be decided rather than assumed.

  Shipped with the demo: the leakage counterfactual as a **declared manifest that must fail** the
  same gate that passes the real one (`manifests/preprocessing_manifest_naive.json` → 3 ×
  `PREPROCESS_BEFORE_SPLIT`), the per-case CSVs behind every reported number, 18 metric unit tests on
  synthetic volumes with answers derived on paper, a reference audit recording that a fuzzy CrossRef
  query returned the **wrong paper for two of four** citations before DOI lookup was used instead,
  and `FRICTION.md` — every point in nine days that needed engineering knowledge, which is what makes
  "can a clinician do this without an engineer?" an honest question to ask.

  `reproduce.sh` runs both gates, the counterfactual, the unit tests and the full across-cohort
  analysis on a laptop from the shipped CSVs, and **prints rather than pretends** for the two tiers
  that need ~25 GB of public data and ~50 GPU-hours.

- **Demo 5, second pass — the manuscript layer, and a cross-substrate review panel that rejected it.**
  Added the analysis and reporting artifacts that Demos 1–3 ship and Demo 5 lacked: five derived
  tables, five figures (including a STARD-style case-flow diagram built through the shipped
  `/make-figures` R pipeline), a title page, a 13-entry DOI-verified bibliography, a rendered DOCX, a
  **44-item CLAIM 2024 assessment**, a reproducibility lock, and a pipeline log.

  Then `/self-review --panel` was run with a **cross-substrate roster** — the manuscript was drafted
  by Claude, so a Claude-only panel would inherit the drafter's blind spots and one lens was routed
  to Codex. **The Codex reviewer returned a Reject and was substantially right**, on points every
  deterministic gate had passed. Eight Majors were accepted; three changed what the paper claims:

  - **Rung 3 is a *constructed* test, not a discovered failure.** The evaluation plan named the
    normalisation contract and predicted the collapse before inference ran — so framing it as a
    clinician landing on a defect "no step asked them to read" overclaimed, because the investigator
    had read exactly that field in advance. The claim is now narrower and defensible: the pipeline is
    *silent* about a known incompatibility.
  - **The causal attribution exceeded the design.** No correctly-normalised MRI arm was run, so
    preprocessing failure and representation failure are not separated. "Located the cause" is gone.
  - **One authored example cannot support general claims about tooling.** The routing-and-severity
    argument is now labelled a hypothesis this example motivates.

  Two of the author's own statements were false against the shipped artifacts and are corrected in
  place: the Abstract said "60 plausible segmentations" while Table 2 records **20 empty predictions**
  (and five more under 1 mL), and "registered in advance" is unprovable here because the plan and the
  results first appear in the same commit.

  Numerical defects the panel found and the gates had not: **HD95 was quoted against the Dice
  denominator** although it is undefined exactly where predictions are empty — the worst cases — so it
  was optimistic by a one-directional selection that grows with the failure rate (9/9, 270/298,
  **40/59**); the **bootstrap interval depended on arm processing order**, so `seed 20260725` pinned the
  run rather than the arm; **Δ-Dice was called a "drop" with no interval** on the difference; and the
  subgroup **labels described a different interval closure from the binning code** (67 external CT
  cases sit at exactly 2.00 mm). All fixed. While fixing the seeding the first patch reached for
  `hash()`, which Python randomises per process — it would have destroyed determinism in the act of
  repairing it; replaced with blake2b and verified stable across `PYTHONHASHSEED`.

  `evaluate_segmentation.py` now **fails** on a missing prediction instead of warning and exiting 0.

- **Demo 4 brought to the same QC completeness, and a contradiction found doing it.** Added the
  artifacts Demos 1–3 ship and Demo 4 lacked: a **CLAIM 2024 assessment** (44 items — 27 PRESENT /
  6 PARTIAL / 7 MISSING / 4 N/A), a pipeline log, `manifest.lock.json` (11 artifacts, verify
  11/11), and a rendered DOCX (pandoc **without** `--citeproc`, because the write-up carries a
  hand-numbered reference list and citeproc would append a second bibliography — the rendered file
  was checked and has none).

  Two things surfaced. First, Demo 4's own self-review had left **RM1 ("references unverified") open
  as a blocker** and nobody closed it. `/verify-refs --strict` now runs clean — 8 of 9 OK, 0
  fabricated, `submission_safe: true` — and the ninth stays **UNVERIFIED by construction**: the
  PyTorch NeurIPS 2019 paper has no CrossRef DOI and no PubMed record, so no registry can confirm
  it. UNVERIFIED is not FABRICATED, and the distinction is now written down instead of left as a
  dangling blocker.

  Second, the checklist found what nothing else had: **the manuscript states package versions that
  no shipped artifact records.** `writeup.md` gives torch 2.12.1 and four others; both
  `pipeline/REPRODUCIBILITY.md` and `pipeline/requirements.txt` say no version set was captured at
  run time ("inventing pins would be a claim never tested"), and `results/results.json` has no
  environment block — while the Reproducibility section asserted the versions "are given in
  Methods" alongside "none are hand-entered". The versions are **kept but flagged in place**: they
  may well be correct, and deleting a possibly-true fact is not more honest than labelling it.

- **A 10-minute conference talk for every demo** (`demo/*/presentation/`). Five decks, each built by
  a `build_deck.py` that **reads every slide number from the shipped artifacts at build time** —
  there is not one typed-in figure in any deck script, so a changed result changes the deck. Titles
  state the finding rather than naming the section, and the figures are the ones the analysis
  already produced.

  Each ships `make_deck.sh`, which runs the two gates this repository requires of a deck and which
  had teeth: `check_slide_tells.py` (chrome on every slide, scaffolding sentences, section-label
  titles, repeated shapes, unlabelled arrows) and `check_deck_budget.py` (words per slide, slides
  per minute, font floor, against the archetype in `deck.qc`). The budget gate rejected four of the
  five decks on the first build and sent them back two or three times each.

- **Demo 5 subtraction round (the deferred half of the panel).** The editor lens's five
  REMOVE/MOVE/TIGHTEN findings, held back from the accuracy round so the two would stay separately
  reviewable, are now applied: **Abstract 543 → 337 words**, Limitations ~230 → 182, body 3,972 →
  3,721. Seeds, resample counts, gate names and the normaliser constants left the Abstract; the
  contrast that does the work stayed. The clinical-claim guard now appears once, on the title page.
  Table legends describe their table instead of naming a CSV path.

  **A subtraction round can delete a fact the floor needed, and this one did.** `seed 20260725` and
  `10,000 resamples` lived *only* in the Abstract, so cutting it removed the bootstrap parameters
  from the manuscript entirely — a reproducibility regression invisible to the very lens that asked
  for the cut, because that lens reads for tone. The instruction was *move to Methods*, not delete.
  Restored as a Methods **Uncertainty** paragraph; every floor gate re-run green afterwards.

  Also: `manuscript/render.sh` now binds DOCX rendering to normalising the audit-source path.
  `/verify-refs` writes the absolute path it was handed into its audit JSON, the repository's PII
  gate rejects it, and scrubbing it by hand after each render was forgotten twice. Binding the two
  makes the leak unable to survive a render.

## [5.24.0] - 2026-07-31

**Hotfix:** several shipped detectors produced a wrong result a user could have believed —
a correct Table 1 was told its percentages were wrong and given specific wrong replacements,
`check_xref` reported `submission_safe: true` on a package missing a cited figure, the
anonymisation gate passed a double-blind institution leak, the language linter advised
"type two diabetes", and `fill_journal_abbrev.py` could not run at all. Released inside the
14-day window under the cadence rule's own hotfix clause.

### Added

- **`CLAUDE.md` — the held-out corpus fence, moved out of a prompt and into the repository.**
  `_corpus/heldout/` exists to be material no detector was written knowing about, and its protocol
  spends a *fresh* corpus by the act of **reading it**. That rule lived in `reverse_engineer/HELDOUT.md`
  and in whatever instructions a given session happened to carry; the repository itself said nothing,
  and there was no `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` for an agent to find.

  On 2026-07-31 an audit was launched against "the repository" with a prohibition list that covered
  editing but never mentioned the corpus. Three of its agents reached `_corpus/heldout/`; one ran a
  detector across the whole corpus, opened two papers, and used the result as evidence for a
  `check_figure_citation` change. That finding was quarantined and **not acted on**; every fix merged
  that day was re-derived from purpose-built fixtures, and the corpus in place had already been
  declared spent, so nothing measurable was lost.

  What the episode demonstrated is worth more than what it cost: `_corpus/` is gitignored, so
  `git status` can never report a change there and a clone does not carry it — and **neither fact
  stops anything that scans the working tree.** A fence that exists only in a prompt is not a fence.
  It now sits at the repository root as the first thing any agent working here is told, with the
  reason attached, because a prohibition without its reason is one an agent will talk itself past.

  `CONTRIBUTING.md` is deliberately left alone: `_corpus/` never reaches an outside contributor, so
  the warning would be noise for the only audience that reads that file.


- **`scripts/check_frontmatter_scope.py` — the gap was never the fix, it was the visibility.**
  `_frontmatter.py` has existed for months and had reached **4 of the 41** detectors that take
  `--manuscript`; the other 37 read YAML front matter as prose, and three of them had already
  fired on it in production. Nothing made that countable, so nothing got swept.

  The gate requires every `--manuscript` detector to strip front matter — directly or through a
  same-directory helper it imports, so the two that strip via `_prose.py` are correctly counted
  as compliant rather than invented as debt — or to appear in an **ALLOWLIST that names it**.
  The list is seeded with the 35 that did not, and it exists to be emptied: a name leaves it when
  that detector is fixed, and a **stale entry is itself a failure**, so the list cannot quietly
  overstate the debt either. New detectors get no grace period.

  Deliberately a list rather than a count: "37 detectors do not strip front matter" is a number
  nobody acts on; a name is a piece of work. Repo-CI validator under `scripts/`, so
  `integrity_detectors` stays **84**.

- **`check_sentence_variety` gained the upper half of the rule it enforces.** Fix rule 7 says
  *"Mix short declarative sentences (8-12 words) with longer ones (25-35 words)"* — a **range** —
  and the gate only ever checked its lower edge. One 97-word sentence populates the `>= 25 words`
  band, so a manuscript passed while the detector printed `max_words: 97` in its own stats. Two
  external reviewers independently read such prose as machine-written, on two different
  manuscripts, while this check returned nothing.

  New `SENTENCE_OVERLONG` (Minor) fires above `--long-max`, default **70 = twice the top of rule
  7's range**. Choosing that number was the delicate part and the measurement is recorded in the
  detector's docstring so it is auditable rather than asserted: firing at rule 7's own top of 35
  would condemn **97 sentences (~24%) across the six manuscripts in this repository with enough
  sentences to measure** — the project's own exemplars, so 25-35 is plainly a target band and not
  a ceiling. At 70 the same corpus yields **4 sentences in 6 manuscripts (~1%)**. The number still
  comes from the skill's specification; the corpus only confirmed it does not condemn good prose.

  The count of sentences over rule 7's band is now reported as `stats.over_rule7_band_count` —
  **information for a rewriter, not a verdict**, for exactly the reason above.

  Regression, not a green suite: against the unfixed detector the suite fails the three assertions
  about the new behaviour and passes the seven that pin the old. A 64-word sentence — over rule 7's
  band, under the ceiling — must stay silent, or the verdict would just re-report the long band the
  gate already checks; and `--long-max 50` must make that same sentence fire, or the default could
  be doing nothing while every other assertion still passed.


- `tests/test_validator_scope.sh` plants the blocked home-directory literal in `references/`,
  `templates/`, `scripts/`, `tests/` and at the skill root, then asserts the validator **names
  each file**. It does not ask whether the validator passes: passing was precisely the symptom.
- **The release-cadence gate's own regression test had an expiry date.** It pinned its fixture
  tag to a literal `2026-07-13` and then asserted that a release cut "0 days later" is blocked —
  but the gate measures `date.today() - <tag date>`, so the fixture did not describe a fixed gap,
  it described one that grew by a day per day. The assertion held for fourteen days and then
  became false, and on 2026-07-27 the suite went red for a reason that had nothing to do with the
  gate it was testing. Every fixture date is now derived from today, so a fixture can only encode
  a duration. Verified by regression rather than by the suite turning green: re-aging the fixture
  tag to twenty days reproduces exactly the three gap-dependent failures and leaves the other nine
  passing. (The gate itself was never wrong; `--min-days 14` and both exemptions behaved as
  specified throughout.)
- **Four shipped skills carried an instruction whose content was not shipped.** Lines of the form
  ``apply `~/.claude/rules/numerical-safety.md` `` told an installed reader to open a file that
  exists on the maintainer's machine and nowhere else. Nothing errored: the step was simply
  skipped, and the skill looked like it enforced something it did not. Each is replaced by the
  generalised rule itself, stated in one or two sentences — no personal history, no project names,
  no rule text copied wholesale. The repo's own 2026-07-11 audit had already named this class;
  it had been open since.

  The remaining 72 references are provenance, not instruction — "English only (per `<path>`)"
  states the rule and then says where it came from — and are deliberately left alone. Blocking
  that shape would rewrite seventy correctly-written citations to no benefit. Instead each of the
  thirteen affected skills now carries one short note saying those paths are the maintainer's
  personal rules, are not shipped, and that a citation standing in for an instruction you need is
  a bug worth reporting.


- A check in `validate_skills.sh` for the shape that caused it: a verb *governing* a
  `~/.claude/rules/` path. Calibrated against real defects rather than a fixture — on the tree
  immediately before it was written, it matched exactly the four imperative references that were
  there and nothing else among 79 total. `see` / `per` / `cross-link` are deliberately not
  matched, and `[^|]` keeps the window inside one markdown table cell so a "must" in one column
  cannot reach a path in another. `tests/test_personal_rule_refs.sh` drives the whole validator
  and asserts it *names* the offending files while staying silent on the provenance form, the
  disclosure note, and the split-table-cell case.

- `american-medical-association.csl` (AMA Manual of Style 11th edition) joins the bundled
  citation styles — superscript, et-al after 6 (first 3 + et al), DOI kept. It covers the JAMA
  family and the many journals whose author guide says only "AMA style"; until now the nearest
  bundled option was `liver-international.csl`, which reaches the same rendering by way of a
  retitled Wiley style.

### Changed

- **`--allow-separate-attachments` now downgrades the `MISSING_BODY` it could not check.** When a
  submission's floats are separate attachment files — the norm in radiology and most of medicine —
  and `check_xref` runs without a `--docx`, those floats are cited, have no body caption, and there
  is no rendered artifact to look them up in. Until now that blocked the submission. The flag is the
  operator's declaration that such floats exist, so it now excuses them.

  **This is an amnesty, and it is priced as one.** In markdown-only mode a caption nobody wrote is
  indistinguishable from an attachment, and both now pass. So the two downgrades are reported apart,
  because their evidence differs: `MISSING_DOCX` means a supplied DOCX *proved* the float absent from
  the rendered output, while `MISSING_BODY` with no DOCX means **nothing was checked**. The second
  prints as `EXCUSED WITHOUT EVIDENCE`, names every row, and is counted separately in the audit JSON
  as `summary.downgraded_unchecked` — a consumer cannot read one as the other. The run tells you to
  come back with `--docx`, which is what converts the excuse into evidence.

  **What the flag still does not excuse**: `MISMATCH`, and a `MISSING_BODY` whose float **is** in the
  rendered DOCX. There the build pipeline is the only place that knows the caption text, which is SSOT
  drift; no attachment policy makes that acceptable, and the run says so by name when it blocks.

  Six documentation sites stated the old contract ("`MISSING_BODY` remains FAIL regardless") and all
  six move together: `manage-refs/SKILL.md`, `check_xref_symptoms.md`, `self-review/SKILL.md`,
  `phase2_5d_xref_qc.md`, `write-paper/SKILL.md`, `phase7_polish_detail.md`, plus the `--help` text
  and `pre_submission_gate.sh`. Verified by regression: the 13-case suite fails 7 against the previous
  behaviour and the 6 it passes are exactly the invariants that must not move — drift still blocks,
  the flag stays opt-in, and a supplied DOCX still produces an evidenced downgrade.

### Fixed

- **Two of the four documented install paths were broken, and the worse one succeeded.** Install
  Option 1 creates the destination first (`mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills`); Options 2 and 3 did not, and
  on a machine where `~/.claude/skills` does not yet exist — which is every first install — BSD `cp`
  does this:

  ```
  Option 2:  cp: ~/.claude/skills: Not a directory     → nothing copied, at least it is loud
  Option 3:  exit 0, and ~/.claude/skills/SKILL.md     → the skills DIRECTORY became the skill
  ```

  Option 3 is the one that matters: no error, no output, and a `~/.claude/skills` that contains a
  skill's files instead of the skill. Claude Code then finds nothing, and the person following the
  README has no signal to act on. Both now carry the same `mkdir -p` line Option 1 already had;
  verified, including on a re-run so the corrected form stays idempotent.

  No gate added. The recurrence risk is real — these are three-line snippets nobody executes — but a
  CI check that runs documented install commands is a new gate, and that is a decision to make
  deliberately rather than as a side effect of a two-line fix.
- **The anonymisation gate declared a double-blind leak clean because it was in a `.yaml`.**
  `check_asset_anonymization` scanned `.r` and `.py` under `figures/`. But `/make-figures` documents
  its STROBE builder as `build_strobe_template.py --config figures/figure1_strobe.yaml`, and the
  first box of a STROBE flow diagram is exactly where *"Patients screened at &lt;Hospital&gt;"* lives.
  The identical string, in the same directory, got opposite verdicts:

  ```
  figures/figure1_strobe.py    ->  FAIL: institution-like token in figure script
  figures/figure1_strobe.yaml  ->  PASS: no anonymization leak   ({'figure_scripts': 0})
  ```

  The `figure_scripts: 0` inside that PASS is the tell — a gate reporting success over an empty
  input set looks exactly like a gate that passed. With the config scanned it reads
  `figure_scripts: 1`, so "found nothing" is now distinguishable from "looked at nothing", and the
  test asserts that counter rather than only the verdict.

  `.yaml`, `.yml` and `.json` under `figures/` are now read the way the scripts already were — as
  text, line by line, which is all this check ever needed. Both formats are in scope because the
  builders in this repo parse both.

  `skills/sync-submission/tests/test_anonymization_config_scan.sh` (wired) pins 9 assertions
  including the scope control: the same leak *outside* `figures/` is still not a figure source and
  still passes. Reverting the scanner turns 5 red.

- **The front page understated the verification layer by more than half, and the gate built to
  prevent exactly that was not looking at it.** `README.md` introduced MedSci-Audit as *"a named
  suite of **36 deterministic detectors**"* — the **v4.10** count — while
  `metadata/catalog_counts.json`, `MEDSCI_AUDIT.md` and `paper.md` all said **84**. Anyone deciding
  whether this toolkit was worth installing read 36; the paper claiming 84 sat one link away.

  `validate_catalog_consistency.py` exists to stop that drift and watched
  `["MEDSCI_AUDIT.md", "paper.md"]` — the two files that were already right. Demonstrated both ways:
  with `README.md` in scope the stale number fails as
  `README.md L419 detector total: claims 36, expected 84`; with the previous scope the identical
  file passes as *"OK: SSOT and all doc count claims agree with disk."*

  README is now watched. Its **thirteen** dated version notes ("61 integrity detectors" in the
  v5.21 entry, and so on) are untouched and unflagged — the detector patterns were already scoped
  to current-state phrasings, so a release note recording the count at its release stays correct as
  history rather than being rewritten.

- **`check_figure_citation` reported three orphan floats where there were none.** The detector emits
  five verdicts, only two of which are orphans, and its summary line counted by **severity** while
  printing the result as a **kind**:

  ```
  REVIEW: 3 orphan float(s).
  ```

  — on the repository's own `demo/01_wisconsin_bc`, where the orphan count is zero and all three
  findings were `FIGURE_NOT_EMBEDDED`. The reader is sent looking for uncited floats that do not
  exist. The summary now counts by verdict and names each part only when it occurred.

  **And a document-level fact was stated once per figure.** `FIGURE_NOT_EMBEDDED`'s condition is
  `not IMG_LINK_RE.search(text)` — true or false for the whole manuscript, never per figure — yet it
  emitted one claim per caption. Three captioned figures produced three claims of one fact; across
  the three demo manuscripts, **8 claims for 3 documents**, inflating every downstream count that
  treats a claim as a finding. It is now one claim naming every affected figure, so the demos report
  3 instead of 8.

  **The docstring understated the exit contract**, in the direction that matters: it read *"1 with
  `--strict` when any Major (none — Minor only)"* while `FIGURE_ATTR_STALE` is Major unconditionally
  and `FIGURE_NOT_EMBEDDED` escalates to Major under `--require-embedded`. A submission-adjacent gate
  was documented as unable to block. Corrected, and the test exercises both exit paths.

  Evidence for all three comes from `demo/` only; `_corpus/heldout/` was not read (see `CLAUDE.md`).
  `skills/self-review/tests/test_figure_citation_labels.sh` (wired) pins 15 assertions including the
  negative controls — a real orphan still reports as an orphan, a clean manuscript still says OK.
  The pre-existing `test_figure_citation.sh` and its challenge card pass unchanged. Reverting the
  detector turns 9 of the 15 red.


- **`fill_journal_abbrev.py` had never run.** `parse_entries` returned the `Match` objects from
  `re.finditer` while every caller treats the result as the entry **text**, so the first line of work
  raised `TypeError: expected string or bytes-like object, got 're.Match'` — on the first entry, for
  every input. Meanwhile `check_csl_render.py` names this script to the user as the remedy when a
  journal spec needs `shortjournal`, and `manage-refs/SKILL.md` lists it in the tool table. **A tool
  that cannot start is worse than a missing one: it is advertised.**

  A second defect was hidden behind the first and only became reachable once it was fixed: `field()`
  required a trailing comma after the value, and BibTeX makes that comma optional on an entry's
  **last** field — which `doi` very often is. The DOI would have returned None, no PMID lookup would
  happen, and the run would have reported *"0/1 entries"* while exiting 0. Same defect class as the
  reference parser fixed in #445, in a different file.

  Verified end to end against live PubMed: a real entry with a trailing `doi` now resolves and gets
  `shortjournal = {Hepatology}` written back.

  `skills/manage-refs/tests/test_journal_abbrev_parsing.sh` (wired, network-free) pins the parsing
  contract — including the caller's exact first line, where the crash happened — plus the
  absent-DOI negative control. Reverting turns 6 of its 7 assertions red.

- **The heading syntax an author happened to use decided whether they were over a journal's word
  cap.** Markdown has two heading forms and pandoc accepts both; `check_wordcount_cap` recognised
  only ATX, and only to depth three. Under setext —

  ```markdown
  References
  ==========
  ```

  — the heading was never seen, `in_skip` never turned on, and the **entire References section was
  counted as body prose**. Byte-identical prose measured **480 words as ATX and 1,002 as setext**.
  `#### References` failed the same way for a different reason: `#{1,3}` stops at three.

  This gate blocks a submission against a journal's limit, so the failure is not cosmetic — a
  conforming manuscript written in setext could be reported over the cap, and an author would cut
  real content to satisfy it.

  Both forms are now recognised, to all six ATX depths. A setext heading is identified by requiring
  the line above the underline to be non-blank body text, which is exactly what distinguishes it
  from a horizontal rule — the negative control the test pins.

  `skills/sync-submission/tests/test_wordcount_heading_forms.sh` (wired) asserts the invariant
  itself: the same prose measures the same length in either syntax. Reverting the parser turns 3 of
  its 6 assertions red, at 1,002 against an expected 480.

- **A gate saying "cannot submit" was counted as an optional Minor, and the loop stopped.**
  `_qc_findings._MAJOR` knew two words, `MAJOR` and `FATAL`. Detectors were written independently
  and each picked its own vocabulary, so anything else fell into the `else` branch and became Minor.
  `check_placeholders` marks a leftover `TODO` as `blocker` and exits 1 on it **unconditionally** —
  and `refinement_stop`, reading that same artifact, answered:

  ```
  main :  STOP_MINOR_OPTIONAL — "No required edits ... do not treat them as blocking, do not loop"
  now  :  CONTINUE            — "Genuine work remains -- resolve these before treating the loop as done"
  ```

  Six words were affected: `blocker`, `hard` (three detectors), `stale`, `unverifiable`, `FAIL`.
  Membership is **derived from each detector's own exit contract**, not from what the word sounds
  like — each one had to make its detector `return 1`. `Flag` is deliberately excluded, and that is
  the control that makes this a derivation rather than a widening: `check_generated_code` computes
  `n_flag = len(claims) - n_major` and exits only on `n_major`, so its own contract says `Flag` is
  advisory.

  The module's docstring already stated the right rule for an unrecognised **schema** — *"make it
  LOUD, not silent"* — because a controller that quietly skips what it cannot read can report a
  clean `STOP_ZERO_EDIT` over a held Major. An unrecognised **severity** was the same hazard one
  level down, defaulting the other way. It now counts as Major and is named in the output: for a
  stop controller, guessing "major" costs one more loop, while guessing "minor" ends the loop over
  an unfixed blocker.

  `skills/self-review/tests/test_qc_severity_vocabulary.sh` (wired) pins 17 assertions, and the last
  one closes the class: **every severity literal shipped anywhere in `skills/*/scripts/*.py` must be
  classified deliberately**, so a newly invented word fails CI instead of silently becoming
  optional. It earned its place immediately — it found `unverifiable`
  (`check_checklist_version.py:119`), which this fix's hand enumeration had missed. Reverting the
  controller turns 6 assertions red.

- **`check_slide_tells` flagged the page numbers its own template generator writes.**
  `is_page_number` was `re.fullmatch(r"\d{1,3}", ...)` — a bare `12` and nothing else. Its own
  docstring says a page number "earns its place — someone in Q&A says *go back to 12*", and then it
  exempted none of the forms a deck actually uses:

  ```
  '12'          exempt
  '2 / 57'      FLAGGED   <- what references/generate_pptx_templates.py::_slidenum emits
  '12 of 57'    FLAGGED
  'p. 12'       FLAGGED
  'Page 12'     FLAGGED
  'Slide 4'     FLAGGED
  '- 12 -'      FLAGGED
  ```

  So the detector reported the output of this repo's **own scaffolding** as clutter, under a
  remediation line that reads "Keep the page number". A tool that fails its own generator is the
  clearest possible case of a checker validated against its author's assumptions rather than against
  anything it will meet.

  The exemption now covers `12`, `12.`, `2 / 57`, `2/57`, `12 | 57`, `12 of 57`, `p./pg/Page 12`,
  `Slide 4`, `Slide 4 of 20` and `- 12 -`, and stays a **full** match: a shape whose entire text is
  a page number is furniture, while one that merely contains a number
  (`Confidential — p. 4`, `Study 3 results`) is chrome and still fires.

  `skills/present-paper/tests/test_slide_page_numbers.sh` (wired) pins 23 assertions, and reads the
  generator's format string **out of the generator's source** rather than restating it — so if the
  deck builder's page-number format ever changes without the detector following, the test breaks
  instead of the user's deck. Reverting the exemption turns 12 red.

- **The linter told authors to write "type two diabetes".** `check_small_numbers` flagged any single
  digit followed by a lowercase word. On nine ordinary clinical sentences it was right **twice**;
  the other seven were labels, not counts:

  | sentence | advice given |
  |---|---|
  | Patients with **type 2** diabetes | *"2 diabetes" — spell out* |
  | **Grade 3** adverse events | *"3 adverse" — spell out* |
  | **Stage 4** disease | *"4 disease" — spell out* |
  | **Phase 3** trials | *"3 trials" — spell out* |
  | See **Table 2** for details | *"2 for" — spell out* |
  | appears in **Figure 1** above | *"1 above" — spell out* |
  | At **day 7** follow-up | *"7 follow" — spell out* |

  Advice that turns a correct sentence into a wrong one is the fastest way to teach an author to
  stop running the linter, and "spell out Table 2" additionally breaks `check_figure_citation`,
  which then cannot find the reference — one detector's output made another one's input invalid.

  A digit that **names** something is now exempt, decided by the word before it: 60-odd document and
  clinical designators (Figure/Table/Section/Phase/Grade/Stage/Type/Class/Group/Arm/day/week/year…).
  Keying on the preceding word rather than the following one is the whole point — "8 patients" and
  "3 deaths" are genuine counts and look identical from the right-hand side. Across this repo's own
  markdown the change removes **308 of 1,499** flags (21%) and adds none.

  `skills/polish-language/tests/test_numeral_designators.sh` (wired) pins 16 assertions in both
  directions, including that a designator elsewhere in the line does not excuse a real count later
  in it. Reverting the rule turns 10 red.

- **A citation that ended a sentence swallowed the full stop, and the tool then accused itself.**
  The key pattern allowed `.` anywhere, but pandoc counts internal punctuation as part of a key only
  when a letter or digit follows it. So `...as previously reported @Smith2023.` parsed as the key
  `Smith2023.` — and `check_citation_keys` reported the **same reference** as `UNDEFINED` (no
  `Smith2023.` in the .bib) and as `UNUSED` (nothing cited `Smith2023`) in one run, exit 1. A
  citation ending a sentence is most of them. `;` `,` and `]` already terminated the match; `.`
  `-` `/` `+` leaked, and `.` is the one that ends English sentences. `@Sec.2a` is still one key,
  because there the period is followed by an alphanumeric — pandoc's own rule, now encoded rather
  than approximated.

- **Quarto cross-references were read as bibliography keys.** `@fig-flow`, `@tbl-baseline`,
  `@sec-methods` and the older `@fig:flow` form resolve against the document's own labels;
  `quarto render` compiles a manuscript full of them without complaint. This checker called every
  one an undefined reference and exited 1 — on a manuscript in the shape `scripts/init_project.py`
  scaffolds itself (`manuscript/index.qmd`). They are now excluded from the verdict and **reported
  under their own heading**, so nothing is silently dropped; and a .bib entry that genuinely happens
  to be keyed `fig-...` resolves before the exclusion is ever consulted.

  `skills/manage-refs/tests/test_citation_key_boundaries.sh` (wired) pins 13 assertions including
  the negative controls: a genuinely undefined key still fails and is named, a real `fig-*` bib key
  is not diverted, and `--strict-unused` still fails. Reverting the parser turns 6 red.

- **Writing "Figures 1 and 2" turned off the submission blocker.** `check_xref` recognised only the
  singular mention; the plural "s" breaks its `\s+`, so `Figures 1 and 2`, `Tables 1-3` and
  `Figures 2, 4 and 5` matched **nothing**. That is not a missed note — a float cited only that way
  scored `UNCITED` instead of `MISSING_DOCX`, and `UNCITED` is not in `blocking_statuses`. Two
  manuscripts identical in meaning got opposite verdicts on the same DOCX:

  ```
  "As shown in Figures 1 and 2"        -> exit 0, submission_safe: true
  "As shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2"  -> exit 1, SUBMISSION BLOCKED (Figure 2 missing from the DOCX)
  ```

  Ordinary English disabled the gate; the repetitive phrasing this tool's own examples happen to use
  kept it on. `skill.yml` calls this detector a hard submission blocker, and for anyone who writes
  the way journals ask them to, it was not one.

  Plural mentions are now read, and their number lists **expanded**: `Figures 1-3` is three floats,
  not two, because an endpoint-only read drops Figure 2 — the same missing-blocker outcome, one
  number further in. `to` and `through` are expanded as ranges too, since the list pattern already
  accepted them as joins and would otherwise have dropped the interior of `Figures 3 to 5`. A
  descending pair (`Figures 5-2`) is read as two endpoints rather than an invented range, and a
  lettered panel range (`Figure 2A-2C`) is left alone.

  `skills/manage-refs/tests/test_xref_plural_citations.sh` (wired) pins the equivalence itself — the
  same package must get the same verdict however the citation is phrased — plus the negative
  controls: a genuinely uncited figure still reports `UNCITED`, a complete package still exits 0,
  and the singular is not double-counted inside the plural. Reverting the parser turns 6 of its 11
  assertions red, including `submission_safe expected=False actual=True`.

- **`check_table_percentages` invented a denominator, then reported false arithmetic as a MAJOR.**
  The most common table in clinical research is a Table 1 of independent binary characteristics with
  N stated in the **caption**. It declares no column `n = N` and has no Total row, so the checker
  fell through to summing the column's own counts — 79 + 53 + 40 + 26 = **198** for a study of 132 —
  and accused all four correct cells, each with a specific wrong replacement percentage, at MAJOR,
  exit 1 under `--strict`. Telling an author to change a right number to a wrong one is worse than
  saying nothing: it is the fastest way to teach someone to stop running the checks.

  **Gating on `is_partition` would have been the wrong fix, and the test pins that too.** That flag
  is derived from the printed percentages summing to ~100, so a partition containing a wrong
  percentage stops looking like a partition — the check would have gone silent on exactly the error
  it exists to catch. (Tried it; the negative control caught it.)

  The rule instead distinguishes a **declared** denominator from an **inferred** one. A header
  `n = N` or a Total row is the author's own statement and is taken at its word: if the arithmetic
  disagrees, that is the finding. A count-sum is the checker's guess, and a guess that reconciles
  **none** of the cells is not evidence that every cell is wrong — it is evidence that the guess is
  wrong. That column now reports `PERCENT_DENOM_UNKNOWN` (INFO) naming the sum it tried and asking
  for a declared N, instead of four accusations.

  Coverage cost, stated rather than hidden: a caption-N table whose percentages are *genuinely*
  wrong is now INFO rather than MAJOR, because nothing in the table distinguishes it from a correct
  one. Recovering N from the caption would close that and is not attempted here.

  `skills/self-review/tests/test_table_percent_denominator.sh` (wired) pins 11 assertions. The
  original code fails 3; the `is_partition` version fails 2 different ones.

- **A BibTeX entry's last field was not a field.** BibTeX makes the comma after an entry's final
  field optional; the `doi` and `title` regexes both required one. So any entry ending in
  `doi = {...}` — an extremely common shape — yielded `record.doi == ""`, which **skips the CrossRef
  check entirely** and drops the record onto the soft-flagged OpenAlex title path where the
  full-author cross-check is disabled. The anti-fabrication check `/verify-refs` exists to perform
  was silently off for exactly those references, and it announced nothing: the record simply came
  back verified by a weaker route. All **three** entries in the repo's own shipped fixture
  `skills/verify-refs/tests/fixtures/corporate_author.bib` were being read with no DOI, and
  `detect_duplicates` — which keys on DOI — could not see two entries sharing one.

  `title` had the identical defect needing the opposite remedy: it cannot take an optional comma,
  because a non-greedy match would then stop at the inner `}` of a brace-protected group and return
  *"A multisociety {Delphi"*. Both fields are now read by counting braces, which is correct in both
  positions. An absent DOI still parses as absent — the fix widens what is read, never what is
  assumed.

  Order mattered here: enabling the author cross-check on this population **before** the `and others`
  fix below would have converted a silent gap into a wave of false `AUTHOR MISMATCH` verdicts on
  consortium references, since those are the entries most likely to carry both a trailing DOI and a
  truncated author list.

  `skills/verify-refs/tests/test_bib_last_field.sh` (network-free, wired) pins ten cases across both
  field positions, brace-protected and quote-delimited titles, and the absent-DOI negative control.
  Reverting the parser turns 6 of them red; the mid-entry form that always worked stays green.

- **One error in the release job took out both distribution channels, and there was no way to retry.**
  `gh release create` fails outright when a Release object for the tag already exists. On v5.23.0 it
  did, the step errored, and the job died **before** the npm publish step that follows it. Net effect,
  live until now: the v5.23.0 Release carried **0 assets**, so the ZIP links `README.md` gives
  non-programmers (`releases/latest/download/medsci-skills-classroom-*.zip`, and v5.23.0 *is* latest)
  returned 404; and npm stayed on **5.22.0** while `package.json` said 5.23.0, so
  `npx medsci-skills@latest install` silently installed the previous release. For scale, v5.22.0's two
  ZIPs were downloaded 8 and 7 times — a real path for roughly fifteen people per release, sitting at
  zero.

  Three changes, all repair:

  - The publish step is now **create-or-update**: it edits the notes and re-uploads with `--clobber`
    when the Release exists. The invariant the original comment relied on is preserved — the bytes
    attached are still the ZIPs verified and attested earlier in the same run.
  - It now **asserts the outcome instead of the command's exit code**. A release finishing with fewer
    than two assets fails the step. That is the shape this class hides behind: the command that
    mattered did not run, and the step looked successful.
  - `workflow_dispatch(tag)` gives the job a **recovery path**. A version tag can only be pushed once,
    so a release that failed after the tag landed could not be re-run at all. Every step now reads a
    resolved `RELEASE_TAG`, and the checkout takes the tag, so a dispatch republishes the tagged tree
    rather than a branch.

  `tests/test_release_publish_step.sh` executes the **actual `run:` block extracted from the shipped
  workflow** — not a copy — against a stubbed `gh` whose `release create` errors on an existing
  release exactly as the real one does. Reverting the step turns 4 of its 7 assertions red.

  Writing that test surfaced a latent one next door: `check_test_wiring._referenced_repo_files` built
  each candidate as `root / token`, and an **absolute** token discards `root` entirely. `release.yml`
  has always named `/tmp/release_notes.md`, so the moment that file existed on the runner the gate
  crashed on `relative_to`. Crashing was the good outcome — had it not, the gate would have read a
  file from **outside the repository** into the one-hop text it searches, where any test path inside
  it would have counted as wiring. Absolute and `../` escaping tokens are now dropped. This is the
  same shape as the self-read fixed in #443: the gate's notion of "a file that runs this test" was
  wider than the set of files it can vouch for.

- **`verify_refs` called BibTeX's own "et al." an author mismatch.** `and others` is what
  Zotero, Mendeley, JabRef and a hand-written `.bib` all emit for a list the author chose not
  to type out, and what BibTeX and CSL both render as *et al.* The parser already knew the
  token — it dropped the literal family `others` from the cited list — but did not read it as
  a **declaration**, so `cited=6 vs source=53` became `AUTHOR MISMATCH`: the render-aborting
  verdict, on a correct reference. The escape hatch that existed, `_audit_truncated = N`, is a
  field this toolkit invented and no reference manager writes. The universal way to declare a
  truncation failed and the private way succeeded, which is backwards — and it failed hardest
  on multisociety guidelines and consortium papers, the reference class clinical manuscripts
  cite most.

  `and others` now sets the same truncation flag, in the trailing position where BibTeX
  defines it. Declaring a truncation still buys **nothing** else: a cited family that does not
  match the source, a cited author the source does not have, and an undeclared short list all
  still fire. `skills/verify-refs/tests/test_bibtex_et_al.sh` (network-free, wired) pins all
  four, and reverting the one-line fix turns it red.

- **The regression test for the master pre-submission chain had been failing for two months,
  unseen.** `skills/manage-refs/tests/fixtures/pre_submission_gate/` is the end-to-end test for
  the chain `manage-refs/SKILL.md` recommends before any submission. Its own `refs.bib` uses
  `and others`, so it broke the day the author cross-check landed (v1.3.0, #41, 2026-05-31) and
  stayed broken until today. Three separate things had to be true for that to go unnoticed, and
  all three are fixed here:

  - `check_test_wiring.py` decides what is a test by its **name**, and this one is called
    `run.sh`. A gate for finding unrun tests must not have a naming blind spot; anything under
    a `tests/` directory now counts. The fixture is `EXEMPT` with a stated reason (its stage 2
    queries live PubMed/CrossRef, so wiring it would make a green build depend on a third-party
    API) — visible and justified rather than invisible.
  - That same gate **read its own source**. CI runs it, so its file landed in the one-hop text
    it searches, and writing a test's path anywhere inside it — a comment, an exemption reason
    — marked that test wired. Adding one explanatory sentence to `EXEMPT` turned a genuinely
    unwired test green; removing the sentence turned it red again. The gate no longer reads
    itself, so `EXEMPT` is the only way to excuse a test.
  - The fixture's own network-skip guard **could never match**: it grepped the single-line
    literal `"verify_refs", "status": "FAIL"` against a pretty-printed artifact that writes
    `"stage"` and `"status"` on separate lines. That it was dead is lucky — alive, it would
    have skipped on *any* verify_refs failure, hiding exactly the content regression the
    fixture exists to catch. It now skips on the transport failing, never on the verdict.

- **`CONTRIBUTING.md` promised every detector a challenge directory; 26 of 84 have one.**
  The sentence read *"Each deterministic detector additionally ships a self-contained
  `<detector>_challenge/` directory"* — stated as a property of the codebase, in the document
  whose whole job is telling an outside contributor what is true here. It was wrong twice:
  the directories are named after the **feature** under test, not always a single script, and
  48 of them cover 84 detectors. A contributor who went looking for the one belonging to the
  detector they were extending would have found nothing and had to guess whether they had
  misread the repo or the repo had misread itself. The text now states the coverage as a
  number and hands over the loop that prints the 58 detectors still without one — turning a
  false claim into an entry point for the contribution this project is actually short of.
  No gate: the count moves with every merge, and a gate here would only pin a promise nobody
  made.

- **`check_claim_artifact` read a manuscript's own changelog as a confession.** A pandoc
  manuscript opens with a `---`-fenced YAML block, and projects keep real sentences in it. A
  `changelog:` entry saying *"the primary endpoint was changed from 30-day to 90-day mortality"*
  was scanned as body prose and returned `PRIMARY_REASSIGNED` — a **P0** — so a project was
  penalised for keeping an honest record. A Major that fires harder the more openly a project
  documents itself is the Major most likely to get waved through, and estimand provenance is
  exactly the gate that must not be. The detector now strips front matter first; the same
  sentence in the body still fires, which is what makes the fix meaningful rather than a mute.


- **`check_xref` told a correctly packaged submission it was blocked, and offered no way out.**
  When supplementary tables and figures are separate attachment files — the norm in radiology and
  most medical journals — and the check runs without `--docx`, those floats are cited, have no body
  caption, and land on `MISSING_BODY`. `--allow-separate-attachments` does not touch them, because a
  float only *becomes* the downgradeable `MISSING_DOCX` once a `--docx` has shown it absent from the
  rendered output. The run printed `SUBMISSION BLOCKED` with nothing to act on.

  `MISSING_BODY` was carrying two situations under one name, and every triage table in this repo
  describes only one of them. With a DOCX present it means build SSOT drift — the float is rendered
  but nothing defines its caption — and that stays a P0. With no DOCX there is nothing to have
  drifted *from*, and the run cannot tell a forgotten caption from a separate supplement file.

  **No verdict changed** — the vocabulary is consumed by `/self-review`, `/write-paper` and
  `/sync-submission` triage tables, and moving a P0 is a decision for a human, not a side effect.
  What changed is that the run now names the labels it could not decide and says that supplying
  `--docx` is what decides them; the `--allow-separate-attachments` downgrades are named rather than
  counted; and the flag's own help text no longer implies it applies where it cannot reach. A gate
  that is red on correct work is a gate the operator learns to skip, which costs more than the check.

  Verified by regression: against the unfixed tree the new suite fails exactly the three assertions
  about the messages and passes all five that pin the verdicts, so the behaviour is provably
  unchanged.

- **The PII scanner had been reading one file per skill.** `validate_skills.sh` held its
  filename patterns in a bare string and expanded it unquoted into `find`, so `*.md` was
  pathname-expanded against the *caller's* working directory before `find` ever saw it. Run from
  the repo root — how CI and every documented invocation run it — that became the thirteen
  top-level `.md` files, `find` aborted with `unknown primary or operator`, and `2>/dev/null`
  swallowed the message. Each loop yielded zero files. The "extended scope" added in 2026-05
  specifically because vendored identifiers hide in `references/`, `templates/` and `scripts/`
  had therefore never scanned any of them, while every run printed PASS for every rule on every
  skill. The patterns are now an array with each glob quoted.

  The blind spot was real, not theoretical: with it closed, the scanner immediately named real
  personal names and institution strings sitting in shipped scripts and in test fixtures — all of
  them already on the precedent blocklist, so the gate had been correct all along and simply
  never got to look. Those are replaced with generic placeholders in this change. Git history is
  not rewritten, so the earlier commits still carry them.

- `skills/*/tests/` is now scanned as well. Fixtures are where a real name settles most easily —
  you reach for a plausible author roster and the nearest plausible one is someone you work with.
  Test files never reach an installer (the bundle excludes `tests/`), but they are in a public
  repository, which is the exposure the blocklist exists to prevent. One of the names found this
  way was inside a fixture called `supplement_pii_clean.md`.

- Two files exist in order to carry personal-looking data — the Korean-PHI corpus that proves
  `/deidentify` fires, and the leaky message that proves `/contribute` blocks a submission — and
  are now exempt from the email rule by path, with the reason recorded beside the exemption.
  Every other rule still applies to them. A journal's published editorial-office address and a
  GitHub `users.noreply` sender are likewise contact information rather than a private address,
  and join the domain whitelist.


- **The CSL registry had drifted from the directory it describes.** `citation_styles/README.md`
  listed 10 of the 16 bundled styles, and `korean-journal-of-radiology.csl` was described as a
  "Vancouver-superscript variant" when it renders parenthesised numbers — the opposite of a
  superscript style, and the kind of error that is only discovered in a proof PDF. The table now
  covers every file on disk, and each row states what the style actually renders (read from the
  CSL, not from the journal's reputation).
- **The documented refresh loop would have overwritten three local variants.** `vancouver.csl`,
  `vancouver-superscript.csl` and `liver-international.csl` carry `<id>` slugs that differ from
  their filenames, so `curl zotero.org/styles/<filename>` fetches a *different* style for each —
  and two of them were already inside the loop. The loop is now restricted to files whose
  filename equals their `<id>` slug, with the exceptions tabulated and a one-liner that
  re-derives the list from disk.
- Two hand-maintained copies of the CSL inventory (`manage-refs/SKILL.md`,
  `write-paper/references/phase7_polish_detail.md`) had each drifted to a different stale subset.
  Both now point at the README and at `render_pandoc.sh`, which prints what is actually on disk
  when it cannot find the requested style.

## [5.23.0] - 2026-07-25

**Pinned reference:** the held-out validation study in `Recursive_Verification_Drift` measures this toolkit's
detectors against a frozen corpus of accepted papers and must report the exact version it measured. A git
SHA is a worse coordinate for a reader trying to reproduce that number than a release is, so this one is cut
four days early to be citable.

### Added

- **Every detector in this repo was tested only against fixtures written alongside it — a training
  set — and nothing ever measured the other number.** A challenge card proving a detector fires on
  its own planted defect is a training accuracy of 100%: true, and uninformative. So as the
  detector count climbed there was no way to answer the question that matters — is the stack
  getting better, or getting better at satisfying itself? `check_detector_crossfire.py` already
  named the gap in its closing paragraph ("a new detector still owes what *no shippable corpus can
  supply*: two real manuscripts, at least one of them known-good"), and no shippable corpus can
  supply it because published papers cannot be committed here.
  `reverse_engineer/scripts/heldout_crossfire.py` points that same machinery (imported, not
  re-implemented — its invocation rules were paid for with 31 clobbered fixtures) at a **local,
  gitignored corpus of real accepted open-access papers** marked `split: heldout` in the manifest.
  What ships is the number, not the papers.
  It is an instrument, not a gate: it never fails a build, and it refuses to overclaim in three
  specific ways. A **fire is not a false positive** — a published paper is not a defect-free
  paper, so the false-positive rate is *withheld entirely* until a human labels the fires
  (`real`/`spurious`/`unsure`) and is always printed with its coverage; treating every fire as an
  error would manufacture the alarming trend it claims to detect. **"Never fired" is reported
  separately from "never ran"** — silence from a detector that was exercised is evidence, silence
  from one that never got a readable subject is not, and the prune decision in the harvest loop
  turns on exactly that distinction, which harvesting project `qc/` directories cannot supply
  because it only sees detectors somebody happened to run. And a corpus is **checked for
  separation, not counted**: six papers sharing one declared `coverage` profile are one pattern
  measured six times, so concentration and identical profiles are named — the corpus-side of the
  rule `check_panel_diversity` already applies to reviewers.
  The trend is the signal, so the ledger is protected from us: a `--only` run cannot be appended,
  because letting a filter enter the series would make the next comparison read our own behaviour
  as a change in the detectors.
- **A held-out source now authorizes nothing, including `synthetic`.** `distill.py` gained a
  development firewall alongside its copyright one: `split: heldout` denies every reuse mode, and
  `frozen_at` (ISO date, required) is what makes "no detector was written knowing this paper"
  checkable rather than asserted. Denying `synthetic` is deliberate — reuse can be non-derivative
  in copyright terms and total in measurement terms, and reading a held-out paper to author a
  fresh probe is exactly how a detector comes to know it. Protocol in
  `reverse_engineer/HELDOUT.md`, which also records what a buffer plus a ledger is *not* yet:
  interleaved replay with distillation (promotion that adds one detector per episode is
  memorisation in the costume of learning), and associative retrieval that edits an existing
  detector instead of appending a new one.

### Fixed

- **Twelve tests shipped on disk that no workflow ran, and the omission had no gate.** PR #412
  wired four unrun challenge cards by hand after a manual sweep — but a hand-maintained list of
  "tests CI should run" has nothing that catches the *next* omission, so the same defect was
  already back: twelve more test assets, six of them declared in a `skill.yml`'s
  `validation_commands`, were green because nothing executed them. All twelve are now wired (they
  pass, offline), and `scripts/check_test_wiring.py` makes the class structurally impossible: every
  `verify.sh` / `test_*.py` / `test_*.sh` must be named by a `run:` step, or by a non-test script a
  `run:` step invokes, or carry a written exemption. Declaring a command in `skill.yml` is not
  wiring — CI does not read that file. This is the third sibling of `check_detector_reachability`
  and `check_script_reachability`; both of their docstrings close the "a test is not a caller"
  direction and left this one open. The gate has no `--strict` — a violation exits 1 always.
  Verified by restoring the real defect: against `validate.yml` as it stood before PR #412 it names
  all four of that PR's detectors, and its self-test deletes a live step and requires the failure.
- **A SKILL.md could hold thirty compliant sections and still cost 22,000 tokens on every
  invocation.** The phase-budget gate bounded the parts (80 lines per section) and said nothing
  about the sum, so `self-review` reached 1,132 lines / ~21,900 estimated tokens and `peer-review`
  ~20,200 with **every section inside the budget**. `check_phase_budget.py` now also enforces a
  whole-file budget (`--max-file-tokens`, default 16,000). `/self-review` is down to ~15,200 —
  **−30%, about 6,700 tokens off every single invocation** — by moving five genuinely conditional
  blocks to `references/phases/` behind trigger rows: the `--panel` phase, the reference
  hallucination/adequacy scans, design-and-power provenance, the `--json` output schema, and fix
  support. Bodies were moved verbatim; a retyped phase is how a phase quietly changes meaning.
  The budget counts **tokens, not lines**, because lines are the wrong unit and this repo is its
  own counter-example: `peer-review` cost ~20,200 tokens in 604 lines while `make-figures` cost
  ~11,900 in 930. By lines, `make-figures` looks like the second-worst file; by what the user pays
  it is fifth, so a line budget would have sent the work to the wrong place. The threshold is a
  ratchet just above the largest accepted file, not a target — the median SKILL.md is ~2,800
  tokens. `peer-review` carries a written `FILE_EXEMPT` entry with its plan until its 24
  study-type Extension blocks are collapsed into one routing table.
- **A duplicated probe list had already drifted.** `self-review`'s Research-Type Adaptation
  re-enumerated the observational O-probes inline and announced "CP1–CP4" while
  `clinical_prediction_model.md` had grown to CP1–CP6. The inline copy is removed; the module is
  the single source for the probe list and its numbering.
- **Two prose detectors carried a byte-identical copy of the same extractor — and only *part* of
  what looked duplicated actually was.** `check_aphorism_density` and `check_rhetorical_density`
  measure different tells over *the same text* (body prose with front matter, headings, tables,
  quotes, fences, list items, citations and inline markup removed) and each held its own copy of
  that extractor: one drift away from reporting densities over different denominators while
  claiming to describe the same prose. The extractor and its three regexes now live in a shared
  same-directory `_prose.py`, the pattern `_frontmatter.py` already established. **Sentence
  splitting is deliberately NOT shared**: the two splitters genuinely differ — the rhetorical one
  starts a sentence at a digit or an opening parenthesis and keeps one-word fragments, the aphorism
  one does neither — so folding them together would have moved every density in both detectors, a
  behaviour change wearing a refactor's clothes. Proven inert: all ten detector outputs across five
  fixtures are byte-identical before and after, and the detector count is unchanged at 84.

- **Four detectors were catalogued and shipped but never CI-tested, and two headline claims were
  false — an independent architecture review (different-substrate cross-check) found them.**
  `check_analysis_definitions`, `check_review_request_types`, and `check_model_provenance` each
  had a full challenge card (positive + negative fixture) that was **never wired into
  `validate.yml`** — they passed every build without their own regression ever running,
  violating `skills/MAINTENANCE.md`'s rule that every detector be self-tested. `check_citation_keys`
  had no challenge card at all; one is added here (an undefined `[@key]` fails, a resolved
  bibliography clears). All four are now CI-wired. This is the same "green that means nothing"
  class the repo already fights elsewhere: a passing build proved the *other* detectors ran, and
  silence on these four read as coverage.
- **"84 stdlib-only detectors" was false** in both `MEDSCI_AUDIT.md` and `paper.md` (the JOSS
  submission): at least three detectors require pandoc / python-docx / PyYAML (`check_csl_render`,
  `check_pool_consistency`, `check_xref`). Corrected to "84 deterministic detectors" with the
  dependency exceptions named; the count-consistency validator's parse pattern was updated in step.
- **`make-figures` contradicted itself on flow diagrams** — the R script is declared the single
  canonical tool and D2 a legacy fallback, then D2 was labelled "(recommended)" a few lines later.
  D2 is now labelled a legacy fallback consistently.
- **Stale detector counts in code comments and skill prose** (a catalog generator said "24", the
  reachability checker said "64", `self-review/SKILL.md` said "Twenty-four" while it owns 31).
  Replaced the hard-coded numbers with drift-proof phrasing that tracks the live catalog, rather
  than re-arming the same drift with a new literal.

- **A test fixture was being published as a real skill, and it broke `gh skill` for the whole
  repository.** `gh skill` (GitHub CLI ≥ 2.90) discovers installable skills by looking for a
  directory literally named `skills` — *at any depth* — and treating every `<name>/SKILL.md`
  beneath it as a skill. The frozen phase-budget regression fixture lived at
  `tests/fixtures/phase_budget/skills/self-review/SKILL.md`. It is a deliberate copy of a
  shipped defect, so it carries no frontmatter, and `gh skill publish --dry-run` therefore
  failed the entire repository on it:

  ```
  error  self-review  missing required field: name
  error  self-review  missing required field: description
  validation failed with 2 error(s)
  ```

  Worse than the failed validation: `gh skill install --all Aperivue/medsci-skills` would have
  handed users a second, broken `self-review` colliding by name with the real one.

  The fixture now sits under `real_defect/` — renamed, not deleted, because it still has to
  prove the phase-budget gate fires on the real 209-line phase. `gh skill publish --dry-run`
  now passes, and `gh skill preview` / `install` already resolved this repository's canonical
  top-level `skills/` layout correctly.

  It survived because nothing in CI ran `gh skill`, and `gh` is not available in the validate
  job — the defect was invisible to a green build. New gate `scripts/check_skill_discovery.py`
  enforces the same property by path arithmetic instead, needing neither network nor `gh`:
  every `SKILL.md` on disk is either canonical (`skills/<name>/SKILL.md` at the repo root) or
  lives outside any directory named `skills`. It reads the **working tree**, not the git index,
  because that is what `gh skill publish` reads — an earlier draft read the index, so moving
  the fixture back with a plain `mv` left the gate reporting OK on the very defect it was
  written for. `tests/test_skill_discovery.sh` pins that distinction along with the failure
  itself. As a top-level `scripts/` validator it is deliberately outside the detector catalog,
  so the detector count is unchanged.
- **17 more journal profiles now answer the AI-disclosure placement question — read out of
  their own policy prose, not invented.** The placement gate shipped with five profiles
  populated, which left every other target producing the "no target recorded" prompt. The
  answer was already written in most profiles, in their own words: *"Disclose substantive AI
  use in Methods"* (JNIS, Journal of Stroke), *"declared in the Methods section"* (Liver
  International), *"in Methods or Acknowledgements"* (Lancet Digital Health), *"disclose in
  Acknowledgments"* (The Lancet), *"must be disclosed in the cover letter"* (JKMS), *"Title
  page (separate): … AI declaration"* (Academic Radiology). Each new line carries an HTML
  comment quoting the sentence it came from, so the claim is checkable rather than asserted.

  **22 of 55 profiles** now resolve; the challenge asserts **all 22**, not a sample, because a
  wrong line here produces wrong advice — four of them (Academic Radiology, JKMS, British
  Journal of Radiology, Diabetes & Metabolism Journal) legitimately make an in-body disclosure
  a **Major**, and getting one of those backwards would tell an author to move something
  correct.

  One convention fell out and is documented in the detector: a journal whose body location is
  named nothing like "Methods" — JACC: Advances asks for a *"Declaration of generative AI…"*
  section immediately above the References — writes **`(body)`** in the placement string.
  Without it that location reads as non-body, which is the exact failure the gate exists to
  stop. The challenge pins both halves: with the marker silent, without it firing.

  No new detector: the count stays **84**.

- **`INBODY_AI_DISCLOSURE` asserted a placement it could not know — and the journals
  disagree.** The verdict said an in-body AI-use disclosure "belongs on the title page". That
  is true at some journals and false at others, and the profiles in this repo already said so
  in their own words: npj Digital Medicine *"document use in Methods section"*, Investigative
  Radiology *"disclosed in cover letter and Acknowledgments section"*, Diabetes & Metabolism
  Journal *"must be declared on title page"*, British Journal of Radiology *"AI disclosure in
  the cover letter is required"*. So it fired identically at a journal that wants the paragraph
  exactly where it is and at one that forbids it there, telling the author to move something
  correct.

  Across five real projects it produced eight fires and **not one could be scored** real or
  spurious, because the answer depended on a target nobody had told the detector — the largest
  block of unscoreable labels in the precision ledger. A verdict that cannot be scored can
  never be shown to work.

  The target now decides, read from the journal profile (`--profile`) or given inline
  (`--disclosure-placement`): a **body-legitimate** target (Methods / Acknowledgments) is
  **silent**; a **title-page or cover-letter-only** target is **Major** and names where the
  journal puts it; and with **no target recorded** it drops to **Minor**, naming the ambiguity
  instead of asserting a placement — so an unknown target no longer fails a `--strict` build.
  Five profiles gained an explicit `AI-use disclosure placement` line, each sourced from that
  profile's own existing policy prose and commented with where it came from.

  18-case challenge card wired into CI. `Acknowledgments` is matched as a **stem** — the first
  implementation used a trailing word boundary and fired on Investigative Radiology, whose
  placement is written exactly that way.

  No new detector: the count stays **83**.

- **`check_cohort_arithmetic` was binding numbers that belong to something else — every one
  of its observed fires on a real manuscript was false.** The arithmetic was never wrong; the
  inputs were. Three captures, three ways of latching onto the wrong digit:

  - `"882 KSAR S4-1 events occurred"` bound the **1 of the label "S4-1"** as the event count
    and declared 2.48 per 100 person-years irreconcilable with one event. A hyphen or slash
    before the digit now means it belongs to a label, and when the numerator cannot be bound
    the check says **nothing** — an unbindable count is not evidence of an arithmetic error.
  - `"over 35,581.3 person-years"` — the integer part could not reach the noun past the decimal
    point, so the **fractional digit** matched instead: a cohort of "3 person-years". Person-time
    is now read with its decimal, and the same lookbehind stops a fractional tail standing alone.
  - A one-letter column hint matched a longer word: `"n"` found **`"Normal"`** in the header of
    an exposure-stratified Table 1, so characteristic rows were summed as if they were strata.
    Hints under three characters are now matched exactly, longer ones on a word boundary. The
    identical one-character-substring bug was found and fixed once in
    `check_confounding_completeness`, and never here.

  Found by the detector-precision harvest: precision **0.00 (0/3)** across two `--out` names on
  a live cohort project. A detector whose every observed fire is false teaches its user to skip
  the whole class — and this class (rate back-calculation, exclusion cascades, tier partitions)
  is one nothing else covers, so the cost of the noise was the coverage.

  Both rate false positives are reproduced **verbatim against the pre-fix version** and are
  silent after it. The 16-case challenge card fails **7 assertions** on that version. Its other
  half is the one that matters: an impossible rate, a non-disjoint partition, and a wrong rate
  over *fractional* person-time all still fire — the fix must not buy silence by going blind.

  No new detector: the count stays **83**.

- **A status row is not a finding: `check_confounding_completeness` was reporting ~45
  non-defects as findings, and corrupting the measurement built on top of them.** Its
  `findings` array was the whole per-covariate audit table, and two of that table's three
  verdicts mean *this is fine*: `ADJUSTED` says the covariate was handled, and
  `EXPOSURE_DEFINING_EXEMPT` records a deliberate exemption (adjusting for a component of the
  exposure's own diagnostic criteria is over-adjustment — probe O7). Nothing was wrong with
  the analysis. What was wrong is that every consumer aggregating a project's `qc/` directory
  counts entries in `findings`, so a run reporting "four covariates examined, none of them a
  problem" arrived as **four findings**, with empty messages.

  Found by running the detector-precision harvest over real projects: three runs of this
  detector in one cohort project contributed ~45 pseudo-findings, enough to make it the
  loudest detector in the suite and to seat a 0.00-precision row in the ledger that is
  supposed to grade detectors. A measurement corrupted by the thing it measures.

  `findings` now carries only `UNADJUSTED_IMBALANCED`, each with the **`severity` and
  `message` it never had** — which is why its entries rendered blank in every report. The
  full table is still emitted as **`covariates`**, and the human-readable render walks that,
  so the printed table, all three counts (`n_imbalanced`, `n_unadjusted_imbalanced`,
  `n_exposure_defining_exempt`) and both `--strict` exit codes are unchanged. 19-case
  challenge card wired into CI; restoring the old envelope fails 8 of its assertions.

  No new detector: the count stays **83** (a challenge card, not a gate).


- **A single-organ study run against a multi-organ atlas was measured on the wrong organ, and
  the imbalance gate went quiet because of it.** `profile_imaging_dataset.py` computed
  foreground as every non-zero label index. On a binary dataset that is the target; on a
  15-organ atlas it is the whole annotated upper abdomen. Profiling AMOS22 for a **spleen**
  study, the shipped profiler reported a median foreground of **3.2 %** (CT) and **7.9 %**
  (MRI) where the spleen actually occupies **0.20 %** and **0.58 %** — inflated 15.7× and
  13.6×. The default imbalance threshold is 1 %, so the reported number sat *above* it and the
  true one *below*: `EXTREME_IMBALANCE` and `ACCURACY_UNDER_IMBALANCE` stayed silent on a
  dataset where predicting background everywhere scores 99.8 %. It is not a cosmetic
  discrepancy because it crosses the threshold, and it errs in the unsafe direction every
  time — the union of organs is always the larger number.

  The same blind spot hid missing ground truth. `LABEL_EMPTY` asks whether a label file has any
  foreground; on an atlas the answer is yes even when the *target* is absent. **3 of AMOS22's
  360 labelled cases carry no spleen at all** (2 CT, 1 MRI) — cases that would have entered an
  external-validation arm and scored Dice 0 with nothing on the record to explain why.

  `profile_imaging_dataset.py` gains `--target-label N`, which computes foreground and target
  volume on that index alone (the union is still recorded as `all_label_foreground_fraction`,
  so nothing is lost) and makes `LABEL_EMPTY` mean *this case has none of the target*.
  `--target-label all` declares a genuinely multi-class study. When more than one structure is
  declared and no target is, `check_dataset_profile.py` now raises the minor
  `TARGET_LABEL_UNDECLARED` instead of quietly reporting a number about a different organ.

- **`TEST_SET_UNLABELLED` could not see a test split whose name carried a qualifier.** The
  check tested split names for exact membership in `{test, holdout, held_out, external, eval}`,
  so `amos_test`, `external_ct`, `held-out-set` and `test-fold1` — the names people actually
  write — all slipped it. That is the worst way for this verdict to fail: the split it exists
  for is the split it cannot see. Matching is now over name *tokens* plus adjacent-token joins
  (so two-word members like `held_out` survive tokenisation), and it deliberately does **not**
  reduce to substring search: `contest`, `pretest` and `protest_cohort` are still not test
  splits, with tests holding that line. `testing` joins the synonym set.

- **The preprocessing-leakage gate treated all resampling as leakage-free, and said so in its
  own docstring.** `FIT_BASED_TYPES` omitted `resample`, on the stated reasoning that
  "resample to a fixed spacing … never leaks". True when the spacing is fixed — but nnU-Net
  derives its target spacing from a percentile of the dataset fingerprint, so a resample fitted
  over every case carries held-out geometry into the training grid exactly as an intensity
  statistic does. Audited on a real manifest, the gate flagged the two intensity transforms and
  stayed silent on the resample sitting beside them. Resampling types are now fit-based; a
  target that really is chosen in advance declares `fit_scope: fixed` and stays silent, which
  is the case the docstring had mistaken for the only one.

  All three surfaced by running the shipped skills against AMOS22 and MSD Task09 rather than
  against fixtures. No new detector script: the count stays **80**.

- **A correct quote read through a dirty extraction is no longer reported as an edit the
  author never made.** `check_response_claims` verified a quoted addition by searching the
  manuscript for a **contiguous** string. That assumption breaks the moment the haystack comes
  out of an extractor, because extractors wedge in tokens the source never had: a two-column
  PDF bleeds a reference line into the middle of a sentence (`learners form independent` |
  `civile. Rev Med Suisse 2019;15:1122.` | `assessments before seeing AI output`), a
  line-numbered proof drops the line number inside the clause (`were` | `86` | `performed`),
  footnote and superscript markers land mid-clause, and hyphenation across a line break splits
  one word in two. Every such quote is present and correct; the substring test called it
  **absent** and fired a **major** verdict. In one submission-day session that single
  assumption produced thirteen false positives and came one step from instructing an author to
  delete two accurate verbatim quotes.

  Matching now lives in `_quote_match.py` and **grades** the match instead of answering
  yes/no: `EXACT` (contiguous) · `INTERLEAVED` (all words in order, bounded foreign tokens
  between) · `PARTIAL` (≥80% of words in order — extraction damage) · `ABSENT`. Only `ABSENT`
  still yields the major `RESPONSE_QUOTE_UNVERIFIED`; the middle two yield a new **minor**
  `RESPONSE_QUOTE_UNRESOLVED` that reports the doubt and does **not** fail `--strict`.
  Line-break hyphenation is repaired outright, so that case produces no finding at all.

  Precision comes from an **interruption count**, not a token budget — a real extraction
  artifact interrupts a sentence once or twice (and an interruption can be long), while a
  spurious "match" interrupts at nearly every word. So at most 4 interrupted joins, ≤25 foreign
  tokens at any one join, plus a total sanity cap. A quote whose words are scattered a
  paragraph apart across a Discussion is still `ABSENT` and still major — locked down by a test.
  `--strict` now halts on major findings only, which is what its help text always promised.
  No new detector: the count stays **80** (`_quote_match.py` is a helper, imported same-dir).

### Added

- **`/model-sourcing` — vetting the concrete model, not the architecture family.** `/architecture-zoo`
  answers which family of model suits a task, and stops there by design. The next question is a
  different kind: *which artifact do I actually run* — this repository, this revision, this
  checkpoint. Nothing owned it, so it was done by hand and by habit, and habit checks the two
  facts that cannot answer it.

  The licence says whether you may use it. The citation count says whether others did. Neither
  says **whether the number you are about to report means what you will say it means.** A method
  developed and tuned against a benchmark family gets evaluated by the next person on that same
  family, and the resulting figure reads like validation while sitting closer to a training-set
  score. The repository will not tell you: the licence is clean, the paper is peer-reviewed and
  highly cited, the task matches, the code runs. The conflict lives in the *relationship* between
  two facts documented in different places — what the model was developed on, and what you are
  about to evaluate it on — and becomes visible only when they are written down side by side.

  The skill writes them down side by side. A **model dossier** records source and version pin,
  licence and the file it was read from, intended use, pretrained-weight provenance, model task
  vs study task, reported validation, `developed_on`, and the study's evaluation arms;
  `check_model_provenance.py` then decides ten verdicts by set arithmetic over it —
  `BENCHMARK_PROVENANCE_CONFLICT`, `EVAL_DATA_IN_TRAINING`, `LICENCE_UNSTATED`,
  `LICENCE_INCOMPATIBLE`, `WEIGHTS_PROVENANCE_UNKNOWN` (Major); `TASK_MISMATCH`,
  `NO_VERSION_PIN`, `VALIDATION_UNREPORTED`, `HARDWARE_UNVERIFIED`, `LICENCE_UNVERIFIED` (Minor).

  **It flags a relationship, not a reputation.** The clean fixture still declares
  `developed_on: ExampleBench` and fires nothing, because no evaluation arm uses ExampleBench.
  Being developed on a benchmark is not a defect; evaluating on it and calling that independent
  is. Dataset names match as token sequences with a small family-alias table, so
  `MSD Task09 Spleen` matches `MSD` while `MS Cohort 2026` does not — never substring search,
  under test. Stdlib-only and network-free: no repository is fetched, no licence resolved online,
  and an unstated fact is a finding rather than a value the gate guesses at.

  Grounded in a real sourcing pass: nnU-Net is Apache-2.0, ~5,800 citations, exactly the right
  task, and **it won the 2018 Medical Segmentation Decathlon** — so an internal arm on MSD is not
  an independent test of it. Licence and citation count both said "go". Skills 57 -> 58,
  detectors 83 -> 84.

- **`/sync-submission` now checks CRediT as a factual claim rather than a formatting block.**
  Contribution terms are published with the paper and every co-author reads them, but nothing
  tied a term to anything. During one byline negotiation three terms were requested in
  sequence — Visualization, Methodology, Formal analysis — each unsupported by the project
  record (zero embedded images and untouched figure legends; an analysis protocol frozen two
  days before the author joined; coding recorded as two named coders whose blind passes
  predated their arrival). A fourth, Conceptualization, was **entirely legitimate** and had no
  repository artifact at all: it lived in email and in a critique that drove a restructure.

  That asymmetry is the design. `check_credit_integrity.py` (detectors **82 → 83**) makes the
  checkable half deterministic — `CREDIT_TERM_INVALID` for a term outside the official
  fourteen ("Statistical analysis", "Manuscript writing" and "Study design" all read as CRediT
  and are not; the message names what was meant), `CREDIT_INITIALS_UNRESOLVED` for initials
  matching no author or two, which is exactly the residue a byline edit leaves behind, and
  `CREDIT_AUTHOR_UNLISTED` for a byline author credited nowhere. The unprovable half stays a
  **prompt**: `CREDIT_UNCORROBORATED` fires on a term with no footprint and can be answered
  with an attestation, because a gate that failed the build on an off-repo contribution would
  be wrong and would teach its user to switch it off.

  **Author order and equal-contribution designation are never gated** — they are negotiated,
  and conflating them with the taxonomy is why they get edited as one block. Two further
  refusals to guess: with fewer than two resolvable byline names the author/initials
  cross-check is skipped and says so (a wrong byline accuses every author at once), and the
  artifact-corroboration half runs only if the project already keeps a contribution record.
  The original proposal wanted it checked against a figure-provenance table and an analysis
  record; neither convention exists in this toolkit, and building against them would mean
  inventing the convention and then gating against our own invention.

- **`/sync-submission` now checks the declarations that the portal PUBLISHES IN PLACE OF the
  manuscript.** Some portals publish the box, not the paper. SNAPP prints it on the submission
  form at four fields — Author Contributions, Competing Interests, Data Availability,
  Acknowledgements: *"This replaces any statement written within the manuscript and is the one
  that we will publish."* So the manuscript file is the copy reviewers read and the portal box
  is the copy the world gets, and a declaration that lives only in the manuscript will not
  exist in the published record. Nothing warns you, because neither document is wrong on its
  own — the loss appears in the galley.

  Two sentences came one click from vanishing this way. **Co-first authorship**: a `†` footnote
  on the title page, and no equal-contribution checkbox anywhere on the author page, so unless
  the sentence is typed into the Author Contributions box the published paper has no co-first
  authors. **"The funder had no role in study design…"**: it lived in the manuscript's
  Acknowledgements, while the structured *Research funding* field takes a funder and a grant ID
  and has nowhere to put a role disclaimer.

  `check_portal_mirror.py` (detectors **81 → 82**) diffs each replacing manuscript section
  against its paste artifact — `PORTAL_FIELD_NOT_MIRRORED` for a sentence with no home,
  `PORTAL_FIELD_MISSING` for a replacing field with no artifact at all, and
  `EQUAL_CONTRIBUTION_NOT_IN_PORTAL`, which is checked against the **whole manuscript** because
  the sentence is normally a title-page footnote rather than part of the contributions section.
  Wired into `preflight_gate.py` as P1 (`--strict`-promotable). It is the complement of the
  existing residue gate, not a duplicate: that one asks whether what you paste is *clean*, this
  asks whether what you did *not* paste is quietly gone.

  **`--emit` is the actual fix**: it writes each field straight from the manuscript so the box
  is never hand-composed — which is how both sentences were lost — and lifts the
  equal-contribution statement in from the title page, the one place a section copy cannot
  reach. The emitted scaffold passes the gate, and that round-trip is a test.

  Which fields replace is a **journal fact, not a guess**: it is read from a new `## Portal
  Mechanics` block in the journal profile (npj Digital Medicine populated, including the
  no-`.png` figure formats, the cover-letter-as-upload, the double-figure trap, and the
  affiliation parser that silently drops intermediate levels). A journal whose contract has
  never been recorded makes the check exit 2 and assert nothing. Matching is graded through the
  vendored `_quote_match.py`, so **re-flowing a sentence while pasting is not reported as a
  loss** — the false positive that would have made the gate unusable.

- **`/verify-refs` now checks whether a cited source actually says what the citing sentence
  says it says.** `verify_refs.py` answers whether a reference is real and whose it is; nothing
  answered whether the *sentence attached to it* is true of it. A citation can be perfectly
  real while the claim on it is not, and that failure survives every existing gate: the DOI
  resolves, the authors match, the reference list renders, and the sentence is still wrong. The
  incident: a manuscript read *"the field has begun to offer the chair [41]"*. The cited work
  uses "chair" zero times and "advocate" four times, twice in the sense the sentence was
  reaching for. A **co-author** caught it by reading the source. The toolkit could not have.

  `check_claim_fidelity.py` (detectors **80 → 81**) checks the claims that have a checkable
  answer, against full texts already downloaded and converted by `/fulltext-retrieval` — it
  never fetches, so it stays deterministic and CI-runnable. `CITED_QUOTE_ABSENT` (major) is
  quoted text that is not in the source in any reading order. `ATTRIBUTION_UNSUPPORTED` and
  `ORDINAL_CLAIM_UNSUPPORTED` are **prompts, not blockers**: paraphrase is legitimate, and a
  gate that fails a build over rewording is a gate that gets switched off.

  The precision argument is the whole design. Attribution fires only when **not one** content
  word of the attributed claim appears in the source in any morphological form — a real
  paraphrase almost always keeps one of the source's own terms ("propose a framework for
  oversight" keeps *oversight*); an attribution to the wrong concept keeps none. A count fires
  only when the noun **is** in the source (so the concept was located) but the stated cardinal
  never appears near it. Float ordinals ("as in Table 2 of [12]") are deliberately **not**
  checked: a manuscript cites its own Table 2 constantly, often in a sentence that also carries
  a citation, so that probe would fire mostly on correct prose.

  Every verdict is an argument from absence, so two guards keep it honest. A source whose
  extracted text is an abstract is reported as **too short to judge** and yields no findings at
  all; a citation with no full text on disk is reported **unresolved** and never guessed at.
  And quote matching reuses `_quote_match.py`, so a correct quote read through a dirty
  extraction is `UNRESOLVED`, not a fabrication charge — the challenge card proves that
  inheritance is live by grading a quote the source contains only with a PDF line number and a
  bled reference wedged mid-sentence, where a contiguous test finds nothing. Both sides of the
  tolerance boundary are pinned: a heavy rewrite is major, a two-word operator flip inside a
  long quotation is a prompt, because nothing in one extracted text distinguishes "the author
  changed two words" from "the extractor dropped two words".

  Resolution needs no hand-built map: `[@key]` goes through the `.bib` DOI, and `[N]` is read
  off a **wrapped** numbered reference list in the manuscript itself — the Word/EndNote path,
  which has no `.bib` at all and where the DOI usually sits on the continuation line. 26-case
  challenge card wired into CI. `_quote_match.py` is vendored into `/verify-refs` (skills ship
  standalone, so a cross-skill import is forbidden) and the vendoring gate — which until now
  could only guard Markdown sets — now guards code too.

- **`/polish-language` now reads figure SOURCES, catching spelling a rendered raster hides —
  and the shared US/UK families stopped counting words that are identical in both dialects.**
  Phase 1 only sees prose; text baked into a figure lives in a PNG/TIFF where no grep reaches,
  so a co-author's "Behavioural alignment" in a PowerPoint panel ships a UK word into a US
  manuscript and surfaces only when someone opens the image. New `lint_figure_locale.py` scans
  the sources instead — `<a:t>` runs inside `*.pptx` slide XML and the text of `*.py`/`*.R`
  plotting scripts — against a `spelling:` front-matter field or the body's own US/UK majority,
  emitting `FIGURE_LOCALE_DRIFT` (Minor). No OCR; a missing figures directory exits 0. It is a
  linter alongside `lint_consistency.py`, **not** a MedSci-Audit detector — **detector count
  stays 80**.

### Fixed

- **The US↔UK spelling families counted four universal words as UK evidence.** The `-ise/-ize`
  families matched the UK side with a greedy `\w*` suffix, so words spelled *identically* in
  both dialects were tallied as British: **analysis / analyses**, **organism(s)**,
  **optimism**, and — worst — **characteristic(s)**, the single most common table label in
  clinical medicine. Any US manuscript containing "Baseline characteristics" therefore
  contributed phantom UK evidence to `lint_consistency.py`'s dominant-variant tally. The four
  families now enumerate the genuinely dialectal inflections (`analyse|analysed|analysing|…`),
  with a comment recording why the greedy form must not come back; `randomise`/`standardise`
  have no universal collision and are unchanged. Verified: all seven universals now silent,
  all genuine UK forms still caught (no false negatives), and the existing consistency
  challenge passes unchanged — its "predominantly UK" verdict rests on real UK spellings
  (`analyse`, `Tumour`), not on the phantom hit. Found while building the figure-source gate,
  which would otherwise have inherited the noise directly.

- **The submission pre-flight now catches two portal pitfalls the export default can't:
  over-cap / wrong-format figures, and `≥`/`≤` characters a portal expands to words.** A
  figure bounces at the upload button for reasons decidable from the file on disk — a byte
  size (JACC: Asia caps a figure at 25 MB) and an extension (SNAPP accepts only
  `.tiff`/`.jpeg`/`.eps`, **rejecting `.png`**). New `figure_portal_readiness_check.py`
  (stdlib) emits `FIGURE_OVERSIZE` and `FIGURE_FORMAT_REJECTED`, wired into
  `preflight_gate.py` as a P1 check (warns by default, halts under `--strict`, skips cleanly
  when there is no figures directory). It is a pre-flight sub-check, **not** a MedSci-Audit
  detector — its filename avoids the `check_`/`detect_` prefix, so the **detector count stays
  80**. Separately, `check_portal_field_residue` gains a Minor `char_expansion` advisory:
  ScholarOne expands a `≥` in a paste-verbatim field to "{greater than or equal to}" (five
  words), inflating the word count — pre-substitute `>=`/`<=` (only `≥`/`≤` are flagged; `×`
  and the en-dash paste cleanly and are left alone). Both ship reproducible challenge cards
  (byte-file fixtures generated at runtime, no committed binaries). Grounded in a JACC: Asia /
  SNAPP submission cycle; complements the `export_portal_tiff.py` export default (the fix) with
  the pre-flight detection.

- **`/make-figures` gains `export_portal_tiff.py` — a portal-ready TIFF export that a raw
  `magick … output.tiff` cannot safely produce.** Submission portals collide with a rendered
  PNG in two ways: some accept only `.tiff`/`.jpeg`/`.eps` and **reject `.png`** (Springer
  Nature SNAPP), and others **cap a figure at 25 MB** (JACC: Asia) that a raw uncompressed
  600-dpi RGBA TIFF sails past. The exporter LZW-compresses (lossless) and **flattens the
  alpha channel onto white** (a TIFF that keeps alpha prints the transparent regions *black*
  on many production pipelines), then **verifies the output is pixel-identical** to that
  flatten before handing it over — and, with `--max-mb`, refuses (exit 1) an output still over
  the cap so the failure surfaces here, not at the upload button. It is a figure producer
  (Pillow, like `render_core_figures.py`), not a detector — **detector count unchanged**. Ships
  `export_portal_tiff_challenge/` (synthetic RGBA fixture generated at runtime, no committed
  binary): positive asserts LZW + RGB + white-flatten + smaller-than-uncompressed, and two
  negatives prove the flatten and the size-cap assertions bite. Grounded in a JACC: Asia /
  SNAPP submission cycle where a raw RGBA TIFF exceeded the portal cap.

- **`check_citation_order` now audits the in-text reference series, not just numbered floats.**
  The Vancouver rule that governs Tables and Figures governs a fifth series the gate never
  saw: the bracketed reference numbers themselves (`[12]`, `[4–11]`). They must ascend by
  first appearance (`REFERENCE_ORDER`, Major), be contiguous from 1 (`REFERENCE_GAP`, Minor),
  and reach the reference-list length (`REFERENCE_COUNT_MISMATCH` — Major when a `[N]` overruns
  the list and dangles, Minor when trailing entries are never cited). A citeproc `[@key]`
  manuscript has no numbers to check and stays silent; a **hand-typed `[N]` manuscript** (the
  Word/Zotero placeholder path) previously had no gate at all. Ranges are now **expanded**
  (`[4–11]` → 4..11) before ordering and gap analysis — for the reference series *and* the
  existing float series — so a number sitting inside a rendered range is no longer read as a
  false gap (an endpoint-only reader reported spurious gaps `[10]`/`[37]` sitting inside
  `4–11`/`36–38`). No new detector: the count stays **80**. Verified clean on the bracketed-
  citation demo manuscript and four new fixtures (out-of-order, gap, the range-trap negative,
  and a clean series). Grounded in a real submission cycle where a citeproc build masked a
  hand-typed-`[N]` ordering fault. See the journal technical-check gate.

- **A pre-registered protocol for the evaluation refresh that covers all 80 detectors.**
  `evaluation/REFRESH_PROTOCOL.md` — written before any run, because an analysis plan chosen
  after seeing results is a re-designation, not a derivation, and the toolkit enforces exactly
  that discipline on its users. It splits the question into three arms with different evidentiary
  standing and refuses to blend them: **Arm A** extends the seeded-defect design to every
  detector, per *verdict* rather than per detector, and adds the **hard negative** (a near-miss
  that must stay silent) that E1 never had — the class where the recent `/verify-refs` precision
  bugs actually lived. **Arm B** measures what the evidence base has nothing on and what actually
  decides adoption: **alert burden on clean manuscripts**, with applicability gating so a
  genre-gated detector's silence is not counted as a true negative, and a pre-specified budget
  (0 Major, median ≤ 3 Minor). **Arm C** is the real-use precision ledger, permanently
  out-of-band. Two constraints are recorded up front rather than discovered later: an injection
  benchmark **cannot report precision or sensitivity** (fault injection has no defined defect
  prevalence — E1's own rationale, carried forward), and Arm B **should not be run to completion
  while the only adjudicator is the person who wrote the detectors**, since an author judging his
  own gate inherits the blind spot that produced it. Stages 0–2 are solo-completable; Stage 3 is
  explicitly gated on recruiting an external adjudicator.

- **Perspective structural gate — a Perspective drafted like an original article, caught before a
  co-author does.** `/self-review` gains `check_perspective_structure` (genre-gated to
  `article_type: Perspective`): it flags IMRAD section headings ("Introduction / Methods / Results /
  Discussion") where a Perspective should name sections as argument-moves, and an abstract that
  states its thesis with no authorial move ("we argue" / "we propose" / "here we ..."), which eight
  of nine sampled npj Digital Medicine Perspectives carry. Both Minor (advisory). The parser blanks
  HTML comments, ignores level-3 headings and leading section numbers, skips front/back-matter, and
  evaluates the first abstract only — so a good Perspective (argument-move headings + an authorial
  abstract) stays silent, verified on a real npj DM Perspective. **Detectors 79 → 80.**
  `check_reference_adequacy` also gains a `perspective` bucket so an opinion essay is no longer
  scored against original-research reference targets. Grounded in a cross-journal Perspective corpus
  (npj DM / NEJM AI / RYAI / Radiology / Lancet) and a Codex adversarial design review.

- **Burden-of-disease / health-estimate methodology — the reporting checklist and the "value-add
  analytic layer" playbook a high-output epidemiology group runs.** Reverse-engineered from a set of
  Nature Medicine / Lancet / JAMA / Gut GBD-satellite and nationwide-cohort papers: their edge is not
  per-study rigor (a careful single-center cohort matches it) but a fixed methodology *shell* — swap
  the disease, bolt on one value-add layer, report to a standard. This ships both halves.
  **(1) GATHER** (`/check-reporting`) — the 18-item *Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health
  Estimates Reporting* (Stevens et al., Lancet 2016), the standard every burden/estimate paper is held
  to and the one guideline the suite lacked; registered in the checklist-fidelity manifest so it cannot
  drift from the 18-item statement, and routed for burden-of-disease / comparative-risk / cause-of-death
  estimation study types. **Reporting guidelines 46 → 47.** **(2) A new `/analyze-stats` methodology
  guide** `burden_decomposition_forecasting.md` — population-attributable fraction / comparative risk
  assessment, Das Gupta decomposition (why a rate changed: aging vs population growth vs epidemiological
  change), joinpoint / AAPC trend-break (did a datable policy/shock bend the trend), age-period-cohort
  forecasting (BAPC), Arriaga life-expectancy decomposition, and draw-based uncertainty intervals — with
  the value-add-layer playbook (pick one per paper) and an explicit single-center-cohort adaptation
  (three layers port onto existing follow-up; the ecological "UI-replaces-confounding-control" shortcut
  does not). Also fixes a latent gate defect surfaced by the count bump: `validate_catalog_consistency`
  now scopes the guideline-count claim past dated README version notes (like the detector claim already
  is), so a historical "46 guidelines" note is not falsified when the current count changes — the
  collision only ever surfaces on the first guideline addition, which is this one.

- **`/humanize` (P27) — a density gate for antithesis parallelism and cleft, the sentence-structure
  AI tells the lexical sweeps miss.** The em-dash, passive-voice and AI-vocabulary checks operate
  per instance; they cannot see prose whose every sentence is grammatical but which leans on
  "X *rather than* Y", "*not* X *but* Y", "X, *not* Y", or sentence-initial "*What* … *is* …" /
  "*It is* … *that* …". A native-fluent reader flagged exactly that residue in an AI-drafted
  Perspective that had already cleared the lexical passes — one draft carried 28 "rather than" and
  roughly ten clefts. New detector `check_rhetorical_density.py` (in `/self-review`, the density-gate
  home shared with `check_aphorism_density` / `check_emphasis_density`) counts antithesis markers and
  cleft constructions per 1,000 body words and fires `ANTITHESIS_DENSITY` / `CLEFT_DENSITY` (both
  Minor, independent) only when the rate **and** a raw-count floor both clear a threshold set above
  the rate in this toolkit's own three published-quality demos (where "rather than" runs 1.4–3.8 /
  1,000 and clefts are absent). A lone functional "rather than" — or an "instead of", never counted —
  does not fire; the negative fixture proves a single cleft below the count floor stays silent even
  when its density crosses the line. The rewrite guidance is the M2 test (delete the negative half;
  if a fact vanishes the contrast was functional, keep it; if not, cut it), adapted from the SNL-UCSB
  paper-writing skill's `gate_mechanical.md` (MIT). Brings the detector catalog to **79**. Wired into
  humanize (SKILL.md gate table, ai_patterns.md Pattern 27, Phase 3 M2 fix rule, pre-submission
  checklist).

- **`/make-figures` — STROBE flow diagrams now assert their own exclusion cascade closes.** The
  numbers a reviewer actually sees live as text in the figure, generated from a YAML config,
  and can drift from the prose the manuscript gates check. A real cohort figure once read
  "500 excluded → N = 9,470" while the enrolled box said 10,000, so 10,000 − 500 = 9,500, not
  9,470 — a second exclusion, present in the legend, had been dropped from the figure, and it
  survived a full round of peer review because figure-image numbers are text-grep blind. `build_strobe_template.py` now checks
  that every declared exclusion link balances (`A − Σ(exclusions after A) == next box`): it warns
  loudly on any imbalance and, with `--strict-cascade`, refuses to build. The check is a private
  helper (`scripts/_strobe_cascade.py`) runnable standalone without python-pptx, so it travels
  with the config. Low false-positive by construction — a link is checked only when an exclusion
  is actually declared after it (a branching Analysis leaf with no exclusion between siblings is
  never treated as a cascade step) and a box with no `n = …` count is skipped, not guessed.
  Count-neutral: a build-time validation, not a new detector.

- **`/profile-imaging` — the step that sets the research direction had no skill.** The model
  lane could design a preprocessing pipeline (`preprocess-imaging`), prove a split disjoint
  (`model-validation`) and pick metrics (`model-evaluation`), but nothing established *what the
  dataset is* first — and every one of those later steps assumes you already know. Profiling a
  real public dataset (41 labelled CT cases) surfaced four facts that decide the study before
  any model exists: through-plane spacing ran **1.5–8.0 mm inside a single institution**, the
  target occupied a **median 0.39 % of the volume** (predicting background everywhere scores
  99.6 %), the shipped `imagesTs` "test set" carried **no labels at all**, and organ volume
  spanned 56–502 mL where normal is roughly 100–250 — a clinical subgroup worth *pre-specifying*
  rather than discovering afterwards.

  The skill emits a per-case profile (grid, spacing, orientation, intensity percentiles, label
  values actually present, foreground fraction, target volume in mL) and gates it against the
  researcher's declared plan via `check_dataset_profile` — five Major verdicts
  (`LABEL_SHAPE_MISMATCH`, `LABEL_EMPTY`, `LABEL_VALUE_UNEXPECTED`, `TEST_SET_UNLABELLED`,
  `ACCURACY_UNDER_IMBALANCE`) and five Minor ones (`LABEL_MISSING`, `SPACING_HETEROGENEOUS`,
  `ORIENTATION_MIXED`, `INTENSITY_SCALE_INCONSISTENT`, `EXTREME_IMBALANCE`).

  The gate flags an **undeclared decision, not variability itself**: the clean fixture is just as
  heterogeneous as the defect one — same 5.3× spacing spread, same two orientation codes — and
  fires nothing, because resampling and reorientation are declared. `--spacing-ratio` and
  `--imbalance-frac` are screening defaults, not published cut-points, and are printed in the
  output so a reader sees what was applied. The profiler needs nibabel (it opens images); the
  gate is stdlib-only, so an audit reproduces anywhere the JSON travels.

- **`/self-review` — a refinement loop that never knew when to stop now has a terminal-state
  controller.** Run iteratively (review → revise → review), the floor gates converge to zero
  Major findings, but nothing declared the loop *done*. Because every additive gate can always
  surface one more caveat, an ungrounded loop over-hardens the manuscript — the same findings
  return in new words (the "Mirror Loop") and "no edit needed" is never treated as a valid
  outcome. New **Phase 2.5i** runs `refinement_stop.py` after the ceiling pass: it reads the
  other gates' `qc/*.json` and classifies the loop's terminal state — `CONTINUE` (a floor Major
  remains), `STOP_OVERHARDENING` (floor clean, ceiling flags accumulation — subtraction only, do
  not run another additive pass), `STOP_MINOR_OPTIONAL` (only optional Minor polish left),
  `STOP_ZERO_EDIT` (submission-ready as-is — **a zero-edit result is a first-class PASS**), or
  `INDETERMINATE` (gates not yet run). It is a loop *controller*, not a detector: it carries no
  `check_` prefix, is advisory (it never blocks, so it cannot double-gate the floor detectors
  that already fail under `--strict` on their own Majors), and is **count-neutral**.

- **`/self-review` — the refine loop was anchored to the AI's own previous draft, not the
  last human-approved version.** Each pass silently took the prior AI output as its baseline,
  so a small framing bias compounded across passes — claims strengthened, scope inflated,
  caveats accreted — while every individual pass looked locally reasonable. New **Phase 2.5h**
  runs `check_baseline_drift.py`, which compares the current manuscript against an explicit
  baseline (the frozen `v_N` of manuscript-versioning — a senior/co-author-circulated draft,
  **not** the last AI output) and reports lexical framing drift: `STRENGTH_INFLATION`
  (certainty markers up while hedges fall), `SIGNIFICANCE_INFLATION_DRIFT`
  (novel/pivotal/unprecedented tokens added), `SCOPE_INFLATION_DRIFT` (generalization phrases
  the baseline lacked), and `HEDGE_ACCRETION` (the cumulative form of the over-hardening the
  ceiling pass catches within one pass). Advisory — every finding is Minor and the gate never
  blocks; with no `--baseline` it is a no-op, so it stays silent on the crossfire clean
  fixtures. Conservative by construction: a probe fires only when a density delta exceeds an
  explicit threshold, so a legitimate reword at the same strength clears. Its
  `qc/baseline_drift.json` feeds the loop controller (Phase 2.5i), so a drifted draft does not
  read as a zero-edit PASS. **57 skills / 78 detectors.**

- **`/self-review` — a revision that fixed one finding could break another, and the pass-rate
  hid it.** Self-review was stateless: each run reported the manuscript's current findings, so
  when the author revised to resolve finding X the gate pass-rate rose ("X gone") while nothing
  measured whether the fix *introduced* a new finding Y — or whether a previously-resolved
  finding had resurfaced (the "Mirror Loop": the loop re-deriving, not converging). New
  **Phase 2.5j** runs `refinement_regression.py`, which reads a run-history ledger (one line
  per run, the `verdict@where` fingerprints of that run's findings) plus the current `qc/*.json`
  and reports the **regression axis next to the pass-rate axis**: `resolved` (fixed), `carried`
  (still open), `new` (broke), and `churn` (resurfaced) — verdict `PROGRESSING`, `REGRESSION`,
  `CHURNING` (stop the loop), `CONVERGED`, or `INDETERMINATE` (first run). It is a loop
  *controller*, not a detector (no `check_` prefix, **count-neutral**), and advisory — it never
  blocks. By default it only classifies; `--append` records the current run as the next ledger
  entry. A revision is an improvement only if it resolved findings **and** left the `new`/`churn`
  columns empty.

- **`/self-review` — a panel could span distinct concern axes yet share one model substrate,
  and nothing caught it.** When the generator, the critics, and the verifier run on the same
  model, their blind spots are correlated — the self-critique inherits the very blindness that
  produced the confident draft — and the existing `check_panel_diversity` gate measured
  *concern-axis* diversity, which is orthogonal to *substrate* diversity. Routing at least one
  lens to a different substrate was documented advice but not enforced. `check_panel_diversity`
  now takes a substrate-aware roster (`generator_substrate` + a per-reviewer `substrate` lane:
  `claude`/`codex`/`gpt`/`human`) and fires **`SUBSTRATE_MONOCULTURE`** (Major, blocking under
  `--strict`) when every declared reviewer shares the generator's substrate — making an
  independent lens the **default, not an option**. Skipped when the roster declares no
  substrates (backward compatible; the panel mode is opt-in, so the default single-pass review
  is unaffected). **Count-neutral** — an existing detector gained a verdict, the catalog stays
  78.

### Fixed

- **The MedSci-Audit family table enumerated 72 detectors under a sentence claiming 80.** The
  registry's own per-family rows had gone stale by eight: style/review 18 → **24**,
  confounding/scope/estimand 6 → **7**, data preparation 14 → **15** (`check_aphorism_density`,
  `check_baseline_drift`, `check_perspective_structure`, `check_rewrite_fidelity`,
  `check_rhetorical_density`, `check_sentence_variety`, `check_analysis_definitions`,
  `check_dataset_profile` were missing rows). The total *was* gated — "The 80 detectors fall
  into six audit families" is a watched claim — but **nothing checked that the rows beneath it
  summed to it**, so the flagship audit document contradicted itself in public. Found while
  scoping the family-stratified benchmark, where a stale family size would have misallocated the
  sampling budget. `validate_catalog_consistency` gains **Layer 4**: every family row is asserted
  against `metadata/detectors_catalog.json` — declared count against the family's true size, and
  listed names against its true membership — so a detector added without a row now fails CI
  instead of silently unbalancing the registry. The column header is renamed `Examples` →
  `Detectors`, because the rows are the complete enumeration and the gate now enforces that.
  Regression-tested both ways (count drift and membership drift each FAIL).

- **Drifted public-facing catalog claims corrected, and the consistency gate widened to the phrasings
  that slipped past it.** An external review found several current-state counts stale against the
  disk SSOT (57 skills / 47 guidelines / 80 detectors): README said "All 55 skills" and "All eight
  plugins" (three other lines already said "nine"), `CITATION.cff` said "44 EQUATOR guidelines", and
  `paper.md` (the JOSS submission) said "46 vendored checklists" and "56 task-bounded skills". Each
  is now current. The more consequential fix is the gate: `validate_catalog_consistency` only
  cross-checked the skill count in the tagline+badge, the guideline count under the noun "guidelines"
  in a fixed file set, and the plugin count under the exact phrase "category plugins" — so a prose
  restatement ("All N skills", "N vendored checklists", "N EQUATOR guidelines", "N plugins") drifted
  unseen while the gate's own docstring claimed broader coverage. The gate now also scans
  `CITATION.cff` and `paper.md`, matches `checklists` and the `EQUATOR`/`vendored` qualifiers, checks
  catalog-total skill prose, and catches a bare "N plugins" restatement; a latent `version_note_re`
  bug (it skipped `**v5.21**` but not the three-component `**v5.20.1**`) that would have false-flagged
  a historical note is fixed too. Each new gate branch is regression-tested (reintroduce the old
  number → FAIL). No skill/detector/guideline count change.
- **`paper.md` cited "TRIPOD+AI" with the 2015 original-TRIPOD bibkey.** The JOSS paper's State-of-the-
  Field sentence listed `TRIPOD+AI [@collins2015tripod]`, but that entry is the 2015 TRIPOD Statement
  (Ann Intern Med), not the 2024 AI extension. Added a verified `collins2024tripodai` entry (TRIPOD+AI
  statement, *BMJ* 2024;385:e078378, doi 10.1136/bmj-2023-078378, confirmed against CrossRef) and
  re-pointed the citation; the evaluation fixture that correctly cites plain "TRIPOD" is untouched.

- **`/self-review` — the refinement loop controllers silently skipped every detector that uses
  the `findings` JSON schema, so a floor Major could read as a zero-edit PASS.** `refinement_stop`
  and `refinement_regression` were written against the `{claims, summary}` envelope, but the
  detector suite is not uniform: nine detectors (`check_table_percentages`,
  `check_reported_p_from_counts`, `check_dta_denominators`, `check_nested_group_comparison`,
  `check_reference_adequacy`, and others) list under `findings`, with the verdict in `kind` and a
  `MAJOR` (upper-case) severity — the only contract `check_detector_envelopes` enforces is the
  top-level `detector` key. The controllers read `claims` only, so those gates were dropped
  without a trace: on a real manuscript whose only Major was a `check_table_percentages`
  `PERCENT_MISMATCH`, `refinement_stop` reported `STOP_MINOR_OPTIONAL` (0 Major) and
  `refinement_regression` under-counted the regression. The synthetic challenge fixtures missed
  it because they were all hand-authored in the `{claims, summary}` shape the tools already
  understood. A shared `_qc_findings.parse_gate` now reads both schemas (verdict from
  `verdict`/`kind`/`type`, severity case-insensitively, location from
  `where`/`location`/`line`/`table_line`), prefers an authoritative `summary.n_major` when present
  and otherwise counts Majors per item, and — the key guard — surfaces any `detector`-keyed file
  whose schema it cannot parse as `gates_unparsed` with a WARNING, so a future novel schema is
  loud, not silently dropped. Regression fixtures added: a `findings`-schema Major must be counted
  (→ CONTINUE) and an unrecognised schema must be surfaced. Count-neutral.

- **`/self-review` — two `--manuscript` detectors read a manuscript's YAML front matter as
  body prose and fired on it.** A pandoc manuscript keeps its `status:`, changelog and build
  notes in the leading `---`-fenced block; the shared line-filter idiom (`#`, `|`, `>`, `!`,
  list markers, code fences) matches none of those, so the front matter was scanned as text.
  On a live npj Digital Medicine submission this made **`check_citation_order`** report
  `Tables cited 1, 3, 2` — the sequence came entirely from a `status:` block narrating a
  display-item renumber ("old Table 1 → Supplementary Table S2", "old Table 3 → Box 1") while
  the body cited every float in order — and made **`check_aphorism_density`** list
  `THIS FILE IS THE SSOT` and `Build: python3 build/build_npj.py` among the manuscript's "very
  short declaratives". Both now strip the leading front matter first, via a shared private
  helper (`skills/self-review/scripts/_frontmatter.py`, same fence semantics as
  sync-submission's `_yaml_frontmatter.py`; a lone `---` in the body is never mistaken for
  front matter). Regression fixtures narrate an out-of-order renumber (and pack short negative
  definitions) in the front matter over a clean body — both cases fired before the fix.
  `check_aphorism_density`, shipped without a wired CI test, now has one.

- **The classroom ZIP shipped no licence text at all, and GitHub could not detect our
  licence.** Two defects with one root cause. `LICENSE` was MIT followed by an appended
  third-party index, so GitHub's detector fell back to `NOASSERTION` / "Other" — the repo
  page did not say MIT, awesome-list submissions carried `license: NOASSERTION`, and any
  institution whose legal review gates on a recognised SPDX identifier saw an unlicensed
  package. Separately, `build_classroom_release.py` never included `LICENSE` in the ZIP:
  the distribution aimed at non-programmers went out with neither the MIT notice that MIT
  itself requires be included in "all copies", nor the **CC BY-NC** terms on the bundled
  CARE / MI-CLEAR-LLM / DECIDE-AI checklist summaries, which restrict commercial use and
  which a classroom user had no other way to learn about. `LICENSE` is now the unmodified
  MIT text; the index moved to **`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`**, which ships in both the
  classroom ZIP and the npm tarball and stays under `check_third_party_index.py` (whose
  messages now name the file you actually have to edit). The extraction allowlist
  (`gen_distribution_manifest.py` `PAYLOAD_ROOTS`) and the independent scope-pinning oracle
  in `test_distribution_manifest.py` were widened deliberately, not incidentally — without
  the allowlist entry `update.safe_extract` would have rejected the new files as unlisted.

- **`/self-review` `check_panel_diversity` — a statistics-dedicated reviewer no longer
  reads as a missing `statistics` axis.** `UNCOVERED_AXIS` (Major) fires when a research
  type's expected axis has zero major findings assigned to it, and the family classifier's
  `statistics` lexicon was meta-analysis-flavoured (heterogeneity, pooling, I², DeLong). A
  reader/agreement study's statistical majors — inter-rater **kappa**, **bootstrap**
  resampling, **permutation** tests, **Bonferroni**/FDR, **odds ratio**, **intraclass
  correlation** — matched none of it, classified as `other`, and left the statistics axis
  looking uncovered, so the gate raised an unfounded Major on a panel that in fact covered
  statistics thoroughly. The lexicon now includes the type-agnostic statistical vocabulary
  (effect measures, resampling, agreement, multiplicity siblings, common tests, Bayesian).
  A regression case in `test_panel_diversity.sh` (a stats reviewer using only the
  previously-unmatched vocabulary) **fails on the old lexicon and passes on the new** — the
  fixture was twice decontaminated of terms the old lexicon already matched (a heading
  "Multiplicity", a comment "confidence interval") that masked the defect. Grounding:
  real-failure. Detector count unchanged.

- **`/self-review` `check_figure_citation` — a multi-panel citation is no longer a false
  `FIGURE_ORPHAN`.** The in-text mention regex ended in `(?P<num>\d+)\b`, and there is no
  word boundary between "3" and "a", so `(Figure 3a)` / `(Figure 3b)` — the *only* way
  multi-panel figures are ever cited — matched nothing. Figure 3 then looked uncited and
  `FIGURE_ORPHAN` fired on essentially every manuscript with a multi-panel figure. The
  citation regex now allows an optional single-letter panel suffix (`Figure 3a` cites
  Figure 3); the caption anchor (`Figure 3.` names the whole float) is unchanged, so the
  caption↔citation correspondence the gate relies on is preserved, and a genuinely
  uncited figure still fires. Ships a regression challenge card that **fails on the old
  regex and passes on the new** (a decontaminated fixture — the first attempt hid the bug
  because the image alt-text contained "figure 1"). Grounding: real-failure (co-author
  review of a multi-panel manuscript). Detector count unchanged.

### Added

- **`/self-review` `check_citation_order` — `UNCITED_FLOAT`: a display item with a legend but
  no in-text citation.** The gate already checked that cited floats appear in ascending order; it
  never checked that a float which *exists* is cited at all. A DIR-4084 galley proof shipped with
  three supplements (PRISMA checklist, flow data, a 2×2 reconciliation) that carried full captions
  but were never cited anywhere in the main text — editorial offices and reviewers reject uncited
  tables/figures/supplements, and nothing flagged it. The detector now parses float definitions
  (legend/caption lines: `**Supplementary Table S7.** …`, `Figure 2 | …`) out of the back matter —
  excluding the reference list — and emits `UNCITED_FLOAT` (Minor) for any that the narrative body
  never cites. A float cited only inside its own legend still counts as uncited. Scoped to the
  back-matter headers the order scan already recognises (Figure Legends, Table Legends, Tables,
  Supplementary), so a float defined only in a separate supplement file is out of scope (that needs
  the supplement file as a second input). Count-neutral: a new verdict on an existing detector, not
  a new detector.

- **`/self-review` `check_cohort_arithmetic` — `NESTED_MODEL_NO_BASELINE`: nested discrimination
  models with no base-model row.** A table reported C-indices for several nested models that all
  embedded age + sex (CMB+age+sex = 0.667, MetS+age+sex = 0.671, …) but had **no age+sex-only baseline
  row** — the section was even titled "(age + sex baseline)". "CMB comparable to MetS" was
  uninterpretable because the shared age + sex could account for the discrimination; re-analysis put
  C(age+sex) = 0.648 and the incremental ΔC at only 0.019/0.023. The gate now flags a table with a
  discrimination column (C-index / AUC) where two or more additive ("X + Y") models share a common
  covariate set but no row reports those common covariates alone and no incremental ΔC is stated
  (Minor). Deterministic and header-gated: it only considers tables with a discrimination column and
  `+`-additive model labels, drops non-covariate words from the label, and stays silent when the
  base-model row or a ΔC is present. Regression cases in `test_cohort_arithmetic.sh` fail on the
  pre-verdict detector. Grounding: real-failure. Additive verdict on an existing detector; detector
  count unchanged.

- **`/self-review` `check_scope_coherence` — `GRADIENT_WITHOUT_INTERACTION`: a "gradient across
  strata" claim with no interaction test.** A directional claim across strata can be mistaken for a tested interaction.
  Wording such as "gradient" needs the same interaction-test check as "synergy"
  or "interaction". The gate now
  flags a cross-strata directional claim ("shortest in the high-risk tertile", "monotonically across
  the age strata", "more pronounced in") that carries a stratification context but reports no
  interaction test (interaction term / LRT / p-interaction / effect modification) anywhere (Minor).
  Precision-guarded against the FP-heavy word "gradient": a physical "pressure gradient across the
  stenosis", an MRI "gradient echo", a claim over an "arm" rather than a stratum, a Methods-only
  mention, and any interaction-tested claim all stay clean. Regression cases in
  `test_scope_coherence.sh` fail on the pre-verdict detector. Grounding: real-failure. Additive
  verdict on an existing detector; detector count unchanged.

- **`/self-review` `check_cohort_arithmetic` — `SUBGROUP_DUPLICATE_CI`: the same subgroup
  rendered twice in one table with two different confidence intervals.** A results table listed
  "MetS ≥3 criteria" (OR 4.95, 4.32–5.94) and "MetS-positive (binary)" (OR 4.95, 4.26–5.83) — the
  identical subgroup (same n, same events) relabeled, each with its own independently-resampled
  bootstrap interval; a biostatistics reviewer asks why one group has two CIs. The gate now flags,
  within a single GFM table, two rows sharing the **same effect estimate and identical count columns
  (n / events) but printing different CIs** (Minor). High precision by construction: it requires the
  non-label integer cells to be identical, so two genuinely distinct subgroups with a coincidentally
  equal point estimate do not fire, and a table with no count columns is left alone (the label column,
  which is exactly what differs between the two rows, is excluded from the identity). Regression cases
  in `test_cohort_arithmetic.sh` fail on the pre-verdict detector. Grounding: real-failure. Additive
  verdict on an existing detector; detector count unchanged.

- **`/self-review` `check_panel_diversity` — `--roster` + `PANEL_UNDERRETURN`: a panel whose
  reviewers spawn and return nothing is now a failure, not a silent success.** A `--panel` run spawns
  N reviewers; when some or all return no parseable review, the resulting `panel_reviews.json` is thin
  or empty and nothing errors, so the run reads as a completed panel and can be written up as one.
  Phase 2.6 now writes a `panel_roster.json` (the spawned `reviewer_id`s) before spawning, and the gate
  takes `--roster`: `PANEL_UNDERRETURN` (Major) fires when fewer reviewers returned than were spawned,
  or fewer than 2 returned at all — a panel with <2 returned reviews is a failed run, not a thin one,
  and must not be synthesized or reported as a review. Set arithmetic over two id lists; silent and
  unchanged without a roster (backward compatible). SKILL.md also states that the single-agent fallback
  shares a substrate with the drafter — the weakest grounding on the author's own manuscript — and
  should route at least one lens to a different substrate (the Codex adversarial path) or a human
  co-author. Regression cases in `test_panel_diversity.sh` fail on the pre-roster detector. Grounding:
  real-failure. Detector count unchanged (an additive verdict on an existing detector).

- **`/humanize` — `check_rewrite_fidelity` + `check_sentence_variety` (detectors 73 → 75): the de-AI
  pass finally checks its own contract.** The skill declared two ENFORCED invariants — "every number,
  statistic, p-value and confidence interval must remain identical" and "do not remove or relocate
  citations" — with nothing to enforce them, and prescribed a sentence-length mix (Fix rule 7) that
  nothing measured. It also had **no Bash in its `tools:`**, so the gates it already carried
  (Pattern 13 paren-span, Pattern 25 emphasis density) told the session to run a script it had no
  permission to run; `Bash` is now in the frontmatter. `check_rewrite_fidelity` diffs pre- against
  post-rewrite text on word tokens and returns `NUMBER_DRIFT` / `CITATION_DROP` (Major, blocking
  under `--strict`) plus an advisory `EDIT_FOOTPRINT_HIGH`. The footprint is deliberately **not** a
  hard gate: measured on this skill's own fixtures a *correct* de-AI pass changed 61% of word tokens,
  because Patterns 6 and 18 require replacing formulaic limitation and conclusion paragraphs
  wholesale — a 30%/50% cap of the kind used by general-prose humanizers would fail exactly the edits
  this skill asks for. `check_sentence_variety` fires `SENTENCE_UNIFORM` only when a band the skill
  itself requires is empty (no sentence ≤12 words, or none ≥25), so the threshold is the skill's own
  specification rather than a borrowed corpus statistic; it stays silent below 15 sentences and
  ignores headings, lists, tables, fences, decimals, and academic abbreviations. Both ship
  positive+negative fixtures and CI-wired regression tests (11 assertions). Grounding: real-failure
  (documentation-vs-implementation drift found by audit) — the prompting external tool contributed
  the *mechanism* (bound the rewrite footprint), not its thresholds, which did not survive
  measurement on medical prose.

- **`/humanize` — Pattern 25 was missing from the reference file it tells you to read.** SKILL.md
  instructs "Always read the pattern reference file at the start of a humanize session", and
  `references/ai_patterns.md` had no Pattern 25 definition — it was added to the SKILL.md table in a
  prior release without a matching reference entry, so a session knew the pattern only as one table
  row with no examples, allowlist, or fix strategy. Pattern 25 is now defined in full (BAD/GOOD
  table, legitimate-italics allowlist, detector wiring). The pattern count is corrected from 24 to
  25 across the frontmatter description, scan/verify phases, section heading, Abstract scope
  (`1-21` → `1-21, 25`), and the pre-submission checklist. `references/ai_patterns.md` now also
  records **grounding per pattern**: 1-18 are inherited from an external list and their thresholds
  (em dashes per 1000 words, overall density) are conventional rather than measured on a medical
  corpus, while 19-25 come from observed reviewer, co-author, and rebuttal rounds.

- **`/sync-submission` — `check_portal_field_residue` (detector 72 → 73): markdown that pastes into
  the published field.** Portal free-text files (`abstract.txt`, `keywords.txt`, …) are cut from the
  manuscript markdown so an author can paste them straight into an Editorial Manager / ScholarOne
  field — but nothing strips the markdown at that boundary, so a trailing `---`, a stray `**bold**`,
  or a `cm^2^` superscript pastes into, and is published in, the field literally (real instance: three
  portal-field files each ended with a `---` line). The detector scans **only `.txt`** (a `.md` is
  meant to carry markdown) for six residue kinds — horizontal rule, bold, heading, inline link,
  superscript, subscript — using paired-marker patterns so significance stars (`* p<0.05, ** p<0.01`),
  approximation tildes (`~5%`), numeric ranges (`1~2`), and `C#` do not fire. Wired into the
  `/sync-submission` pre-flight gate as a P1 (strict-promotable) check over `portal_fields/`, so a
  freeze halts on it under `--strict`. Ships a challenge card (all six kinds positive vs a clean file
  packed with the false-positive traps negative) run in CI. Grounding: real-failure.

- **`/meta-analysis` — `check_exclusion_code_validity` (detector 71 → 72): a screening code that
  excludes a design the protocol INCLUDES.** A review whose protocol admitted single-arm case series
  removed three eligible studies under a "not comparative" code. The screening sheet was internally
  perfect — the reviewers agreed, every count reconciled — because the defect was in the *legend*, above
  the cells, where no consistency, arithmetic, or inter-rater gate looks. The detector parses the
  exclusion codes actually applied in the screening artifacts and cross-checks each against the
  registered protocol: `CODE_CONTRADICTS_ELIGIBILITY` (Major — a code excludes a design/population that
  the protocol's own *non-negated* eligibility text names as eligible; the bulk study-loss defect),
  `CODE_NOT_REGISTERED` (Major — an off-protocol code, also PRISMA item 16a registered-vs-used drift),
  and `CODE_RENUMBERED` (Minor — the same code number carries two meanings). Conservative: it stays
  silent unless it can prove the defect (a missing legend or eligibility text → clean, never a false
  positive on absence), and a code that correctly excludes a design the protocol *excludes* does not
  fire. Ships a challenge card (a single-arm-eligible protocol + a "not comparative" code as positive vs
  a comparator-required protocol where the very same code is correct as negative) run in CI. Grounding:
  real-failure.

- **`scripts/run_ci_mirror.py` (+ `.sh`) — the pre-push CI mirror that cannot drift.** The "run the
  gates locally before you push" instruction lived as a hand-copied list in CONTRIBUTING and a global
  rule; `.github/workflows/validate.yml` has ~170 `run:` steps. A copied subset drifts silently and is
  caught only by a red CI *after* a push — the failure this repo kept hitting (a gate added to the
  workflow, or a `--strict` flag, that the prose list never learned about). The helper parses the
  workflow, extracts the `validate` job's `run:` steps **in order**, and executes each one exactly as
  CI does (`bash -e -c`), so the list can never diverge and every gate's flags come along. It skips
  `uses:` steps and dependency-install steps (a gate that then needs a missing tool fails loudly, not
  silently). `--list` shows the gates, `--fail-fast` stops at the first failure, `--only SUBSTR` runs
  one. CONTRIBUTING now points at it instead of a subset; `tests/test_run_ci_mirror.sh` (CI) asserts it
  enumerates the real gates and excludes setup steps. Not a detector (catalog unchanged).

- **`/self-review` — `check_incorporation_bias` (detector 68 → 69): the reference standard and the
  predictor are the same construct.** A reference standard defined by lesion trajectory can overlap with a trajectory
  predictor, making the reported association partly definitional. The detector reads trajectory tokens **only from the
  reference-standard/outcome-defining sentences** and emits `INCORPORATION_BIAS` (Major) when a
  trajectory-named predictor (growth, interval change, increase/decrease in size) is reported as
  associated with the outcome in the same sentence — unless the manuscript already discloses the overlap
  ("incorporation bias", "partly definitional", "not independent of the reference standard"). Covers the
  deterministic size/trajectory sub-class only. Ships a challenge card (trajectory-standard + growth-OR
  positive vs a pathology + follow-up standard negative) run in CI. The challenge fixtures are synthetic and preserve that overlap.

- **Four more field-backlog verdicts on detectors that already run (no new counted detector).**
  - **`check_cohort_arithmetic` — `FOLLOWUP_VS_CRITERION` (Minor).** A reported "median follow-up was
    102 days" against a reference standard requiring "size stability for ≥24 months" reads as if benign
    classification had 102 days to work with. Usually the 102 days is the index-visit interval and the
    total observation window (median 442 days) was simply never stated. Fires when the shortest reported
    follow-up is below the longest duration criterion in the outcome definition **and** no
    total-observation window is separately labelled (that label suppresses it).
  - **`check_figure_citation` — `FIGURE_ATTR_STALE` (Major) + `AUTHOR_CONTRIB_FIGURE_REF` (Minor).** An
    Author-Contributions / CRediT line attributing "prepared Figure 4" when only Figures 1–3 exist is a
    stale attribution from a figure renumber/merge. Scoped strictly to the author-contributions section
    (never Results, where "Figure N" is a normal citation); the advisory flags figure-numbered
    attribution as drift-prone (use the CRediT "Visualization" role).
  - **`check_scope_coherence` — `UNIVERSAL_NEGATIVE_UNSCOPED` (Minor).** A "no published system…",
    "first study to quantify…", "has not been measured" claim in the Abstract/Introduction/Discussion
    with no named discipline-scope qualifier. A single-database search supports "no *clinical* paper does
    X", never "nobody does X". Suppressed by a discipline frame ("…in the radiology literature"); a bare
    "to our knowledge" does not suppress, because that is the failure.
  - **`check_placeholders` — `placeholder_strength_claim` (warn).** A strength assertion
    (near-unanimous / all / every / none / always) on a line that also carries an unresolved `[VERIFY]`
    marker — the claim written at the strength the author *hopes* the pending data has. The marker text
    is stripped before the strength check, so a word inside the marker does not trip it; hedged marked
    lines stay silent.

- **Two more field-backlog gates, both additive verdicts (no new counted detector).**
  - **`check_citation_order` now resolves in-text `Section N` cross-references** (`DANGLING_SECTION_XREF`).
    Many medical journals typeset **unnumbered** headings, so a "as reported in Section 3.4" written
    during drafting dangles at production — a galley-stage flag the float-order check did not cover. The
    verdict fires when a `Section N`/`N.M` reference has no matching numbered heading (and when the
    manuscript has no numbered headings at all, every such reference dangles); `Supplementary`/`Appendix
    Section N` is exempt.
  - **`lint_consistency` now catches thousands-separator drift between a float title and the body**
    (`Thousands separator` section). A table title reading `n = 3.681` while the body writes `3,681`
    survives to galley. High-precision by construction: it fires only when the *same* integer appears
    comma-grouped in the body **and** period-grouped in a float title, so a genuine 3-decimal number
    (never also comma-grouped) does not false-fire.

- **`/self-review` — `check_effect_stability` (detector 67 → 68): a wide interval is a direction, not a
  magnitude.** A wide confidence interval and sparse events can make a headline effect estimate
  unstable even when its direction is supported. The detector recomputes both from
  the printed cells: `UNSTABLE_EFFECT_ESTIMATE` when a headline OR/HR/RR/IRR has a 95% CI upper/lower
  ratio above 10 (`--ratio-threshold`) with no co-located imprecision caveat (exploratory /
  hypothesis-generating / underpowered / imprecise / wide-CI / interpret-with-caution — the same
  suppression discipline as `check_null_calibration`), and `EPV_LOW` when events/covariates < 10. Pure
  arithmetic, no judgment; reads only the headline regions for the ratio so a labelled-exploratory
  subgroup deep in the Results does not fire. Ships a challenge card (a synthetic wide-interval + low-EPV positive
  vs a tight CI + a caveat-labelled wide CI negative) run in CI. The fixture numbers are synthetic.

- **Two more field-backlog gates, again as verdicts on detectors that already run (no new counted
  detector).**
  - **`check_figure_citation` now flags a manuscript that has figure captions but no embedded image**
    (`FIGURE_NOT_EMBEDDED`). A "complete" circulation manuscript can ship with every figure legend and
    not one picture — author-invisible, because the prose reads finished. The check is conservative
    (fires only when *zero* images are embedded, never a per-figure guess) and **advisory by default**
    (a drafting manuscript legitimately keeps figures as separate files); `--require-embedded` — the
    submission preflight — escalates it to Major, where captions-with-no-picture is the failure.
  - **`cover_letter_drift_check` now checks the manuscript TITLE, not only the counts**
    (`TITLE_DRIFT`). The §4 cover-letter gate already caught word/reference/table drift; a title that
    differs across the manuscript frontmatter, the cover letter, and the project config (three live
    titles at once) is a guaranteed desk/technical-check flag it did not see. The manuscript title
    must appear verbatim in the cover letter and match an optional `--config` (`title`/`title_working`)
    field.
  - **`check_cohort_arithmetic` now reads a PROSE partition, not only tables/CSV** (`PARTITION_OVERLAP`).
    A sentence that presents an exhaustive split of a stated total — "of the 289 cases, 37 (12.8%) …
    185 (64.0%) … 103 (35.6%) …" — but whose counts do not sum to the total (325 ≠ 289) or whose
    percentages do not sum to ~100% (112.4%) has mixed a non-exclusive component in among the
    mutually exclusive categories: a "these don't add to N" reviewer flag that every section echoes
    consistently. A **partition-cue gate** keeps it off legitimate overlapping-attribute prose —
    comorbidity prevalence ("210 (72.7%) had hypertension, 140 (48.4%) had diabetes, …") is not a
    partition and its counts legitimately sum above N; the test pins that precision case as a
    must-stay-silent negative.
  - **`check_claim_artifact` now checks registration chronology** (`REGISTRATION_CHRONOLOGY`, Major).
    A "prospectively registered" claim is falsifiable against the manuscript's own dates: if the
    registration date postdates search completion, the review was registered *retrospectively*. The
    check is manuscript-internal (no external pre-registration artifact needed) and fires only when a
    prospective claim co-occurs with a registry and both dates parse and registration > search-end —
    the exact overclaim that recurred across two projects while the prose-only panel probe slipped on
    the second. Reframe to "registered with" or correct the chronology.

## [5.22.0] - 2026-07-21

**Hotfix:** three bundled reporting checklists that shipped in v5.21.0 and earlier — TRIPOD+AI, CLEAR,
and MI-CLEAR-LLM — mis-stated their official item structure, so `/check-reporting` audited manuscripts
against a mislabeled instrument and could report a compliance result the author believed. The fixes are
below; the release does not wait the usual 14 days because a wrong result is already in users' hands.

### Fixed

- **Two more bundled checklists mis-stated their official structure — the same class as #352, found
  by turning the new fidelity gate on the rest of the AI/extension checklists.** *CLEAR* had been
  regrouped into seven invented topical "domains" with item 1 = "Study hypothesis"; the official CLEAR
  (Kocak et al., Insights Imaging 2023;14:75) is numbered by **manuscript section** — item 1 = Title,
  item 2 = Abstract, item 44 = baseline demographics — and its only two non-essential items are 53 and
  58 (the file said 17 and 57). Every CLEAR item number an assessor would have cited was wrong.
  *MI-CLEAR-LLM* was labelled "Version 2025" but carried the 2024 **six-item** body; the official 2025
  update (Park et al., Korean J Radiol 2025;26:1123-1132) has **eight item categories**, promoting
  Access mode, Input data type, and Adaptation strategy to first-class items. Both rebuilt faithfully
  from the published statements (CLEAR verified item-by-item against the open-access full text;
  MI-CLEAR-LLM's eight 2025 categories verified against the paper), the fidelity gate extended to hold
  both to their official inventory, and `test_checklist_fidelity.sh` now regresses all three defects.
  The other seven AI/extension checklists (CLAIM 2024, PROBAST+AI, STARD-AI, TRIPOD-LLM, DECIDE-AI,
  CONSORT-AI, SPIRIT-AI) were checked against their official sources and are faithful.
- **The bundled TRIPOD+AI checklist was TRIPOD 2015 with `-AI` additions, not the official 2024
  statement (issue #352, external report).** The file was labelled "TRIPOD+AI 2024" but carried the
  TRIPOD 2015 section sequence, non-canonical identifiers (`1-AI`, `10-AI-a`, …), and had no Open
  Science or Patient-and-Public-Involvement items. The official TRIPOD+AI 2024 (Collins et al., BMJ
  2024;385:e078378) is a **rewrite**: 27 main items, 52 subitems, with Open science (18) and PPI (19)
  as first-class items. `check-reporting`'s SKILL.md already *said* so ("a complete rewrite, not an
  addendum"); the checklist file did not follow it. Rewritten faithfully from the published statement
  (verified item-by-item against the source; applicability labels D/E/D;E preserved), with the
  toolkit's own engineering-reproducibility prompts (architecture, training config, software/hardware,
  reproducibility) moved to a clearly-labelled "MedSci supplemental checks — NOT official TRIPOD+AI
  items" section.

### Added

- `skills/check-reporting/scripts/verify_checklist_fidelity.py` — the check that was missing. Nothing
  compared a bundled checklist against the official item inventory of the guideline it claims to be:
  `check_checklist_exists` verifies presence, `check_framework_naming` verifies naming, neither
  verifies the *contents*. This gate is manifest-driven (item count, required sections, forbidden
  non-canonical identifiers, source DOI) so it generalises to other checklists by adding an entry, not
  code. It runs in CI via `test_checklist_fidelity.sh`, which regresses the exact #352 defect and
  holds the gate silent on the corrected file. Not a counted detector (a CI fidelity regression, not a
  per-manuscript check).


### Added

- **`check_density_complaint` (detector 66 -> 67, `/revise`): "too dense" is the one comment you
  cannot address by adding text.** A point-by-point revision answers each density comment by adding
  a sentence and comes back **longer** than the version that drew the complaint, every named term
  higher than before, and the shrink the letter asked for slips another round away. The detector is
  arithmetic: if the decision letter carries a density/length complaint
  AND the revised body (Introduction through Discussion, citation markers excluded) did not shrink,
  it fires `DENSITY_COMPLAINT_UNADDRESSED`. With no complaint it stays silent — it is not a
  "shorter is always better" nag. Ships a challenge card reproducing the v_prev -> longer -> shorter
  arithmetic (fires on the longer revision, silent on the shorter one) and the negative control.


### Changed

- **Two dead prose blocks removed from SKILL.md (−35 lines loaded every invocation).** From a
  subtractive audit that sorted every normative sentence in 30 skills into enforced / judgment /
  scriptable / decoration: 71 rules are enforced by a script, 269 legitimately direct the model's
  judgment, and the "decoration" pile — sentences nothing catches, that ship no defective artifact —
  turned out, on line-by-line re-verification, to be far smaller than a first pass claimed. Almost
  everything a first agent flagged was defended and kept ("when in doubt, keep"). Only what could be
  deleted with certainty is cut here:
  - `lit-sync`: a dated dry-run rationale whose only referent was `~/.local/cache/phase1b_b_dryrun/`,
    a machine-local path dead for every installed copy.
  - `present-paper`: a 28-line `<details>` block self-labelled "The original list, for reference" —
    the superseded prior version of the Step 0a load guidance, every file it named still pointed to
    by the current A/B/C + on-demand table above it (verified: no orphaned reference).


### Fixed

- **`check_workflow_yaml.py` could not see the failure that motivated it, one layer down.** It was
  built (#333) after an unquoted `: ` broke `validate.yml` and GitHub ran zero jobs — a failure that
  *disappears* instead of turning a PR red. On 2026-07-15, resolving a merge conflict by keeping both
  sides of a hunk left a `- name:` step whose `run:` had been dropped. The file was valid YAML, this
  gate passed, and GitHub again ran zero jobs ("This run likely failed because of a workflow file
  issue"). The gate now asserts every step in every job has `run:` or `uses:`, and ships the
  self-test #333 never wrote — regressing the runless step, the unquoted `: `, and a jobless file,
  and staying silent on a `uses:`-only step and a properly quoted name.


### Fixed

- **`/revise` was handing the author a sentence to tell an editor, and recommending it for its
  effect rather than its truth.** Category 5 read: *"This analysis was reviewed in consultation with
  our biostatistician" adds credibility.* That is a claim about who looked at the work — a claim
  about the world — offered as a rhetorical move, in a toolkit whose whole thesis is that you do not
  write down what you have not verified. Removed. If a statistician was in fact consulted, say so.
- **Two skills told every user of an international toolkit what language they speak.**
  `/humanize` opened with *"Communicate with the user in Korean"*; `/polish-language` with
  *"Conversation with the user may be in Korean."* This package ships on npm and is starred from
  countries its maintainer has never visited. Both now say what `/publish-skill` already said:
  **in their preferred language.**

  The rule was not missing. It was written down — **in `/publish-skill`, the skill whose job is to
  scrub a personal skill before it goes public**, which lists "Language hardcoding" among the defects
  to remove and prints the replacement. It was a sentence, and nothing executed it, and so the
  repository shipped two violations of its own rule for months.

  *A rule that ships as prose is a rule the model reads and disobeys. The difference between the
  rules that held and the one that did not was not importance. It was executability.*

### Added

- `scripts/check_hardcoded_locale.py` — that sentence, executed. A SKILL.md may name a language as
  the **subject** of the work ("manuscript edits are in English"); it may not choose which language
  to address the **user** in. Naming the defect in order to teach it (as `/publish-skill` does) is
  not committing it — the gate's first draft flagged the one file that had already got this right,
  which is exactly how a gate dies. `tests/test_hardcoded_locale.sh` regresses both forms of the
  defect and holds the gate silent on all three kinds of legitimate use.
- **`/meta-analysis` told every user to run two skills that exist only on the maintainer's laptop.**
  Phase 9: *"Co-author circulation | `/gws` + `/handoff`"*. Neither is in this package; both live in
  `~/.claude/skills`. Anyone who installed from npm and reached Phase 9 was handed an instruction
  they could not follow — and a glimpse of a private toolchain. `/lit-sync` did the same with
  `/obsidian-paper-vault`.
- **`/lit-sync` announced a gate that has never existed.** It said twice that `/verify-refs` treats
  `refs_bib_refreshed: false` as an unverified snapshot and that downstream skills *block* on it.
  `verify_refs.py` has never contained that string. The sentence describing the gate was the only
  thing standing between a stale `refs.bib` and a manuscript. It also routed users to `/render` — a
  skill that does not exist and never has.
- **`/find-journal` ran 71 lines of dead code on every invocation.** Phase 3.6 globs
  `TODO_*_profiles.md`; those files were deleted in the privacy commit (#39). The glob has matched
  nothing since, so the step is loaded into context, evaluated, and skipped, every single time.
  474 -> 404 lines.
- **`/find-journal`'s description told every session something false about itself.** *"No cached
  IF/APC data — users verify current metrics at journal sites."* Twenty-eight of the seventy-three
  shipped profiles cache an APC (`APC ~$3,690`, `APC $4,160`, `APC US$2,000`), thirteen cache an
  impact factor. The description is loaded into **every** session, used or not. It now says what is
  true: those figures are point-in-time and may be stale.

### Added

- `scripts/check_named_skills_exist.py` — the sibling `validate_routing_assets.py` never had. That
  gate refuses to let a SKILL.md point at a `references/` file that is not there; this one refuses to
  let it point at a *skill* that is not there. Tokens that only look like invocations (an Embase
  `/exp`, a path fragment) are exempted **with their reason written down**, so the exemption is a
  decision rather than a hole.


### Fixed

- **`/self-review` `check_analysis_definitions` was reading layout, not defect** (detector #66,
  shipped hours earlier in #340). Two bugs, both caught on the *second* real manuscript:

  1. **It could not see a CHEST manuscript at all.** `METHODS_RE` matched `Methods` /
     `Materials and Methods` / `Patients and Methods`. CHEST *requires* `Study Design and Methods`, so the
     gate emitted `SECTIONS_NOT_FOUND` and silently skipped the whole cross-check. Broadened to accept
     `Study Design and Methods`, `Subjects and Methods`, `Design and Methods`, `Methods and Materials`.

  2. **`MODEL_OUTCOME_UNDEFINED` was a formatting artifact.** It searched for the outcome declaration in a
     400-character window around each model mention. A manuscript that declares its outcome once under
     *Outcomes* and then specifies models under *Statistical Analysis* is following the **recommended**
     structure — and the windowed search fired on it. It flagged a clean manuscript for exactly the reason
     it flagged a rejected one. The declaration is now sought across the **whole Methods section**.

  **This makes the check sound but deliberately narrower.** A model whose outcome is
  never identified still needs semantic review. Distance between paragraphs is
  insufficient evidence that the outcome is missing, so the detector no longer
  treats that proxy as validation.

  `REFERENCE_STANDARD_UNDEFINED` likewise now honours a declared outcome: *reference standard* is
  diagnostic-accuracy vocabulary, and a prognostic model scores its predictions against the outcome it has
  already declared. `MODEL_NOT_IN_METHODS`, `TIER_LABEL_UNDEFINED` and the informational `ANALYSIS_LOAD`
  are unchanged.
- **`make-figures`: an MIT package was redistributing a society's trademark and a published paper's
  patient CT scan — inside a `.pptx`, where the licence gate could not see it.**
  `european_radiology.pptx` was European Radiology's own graphical-abstract template with a
  published article's abstract *still filled into slide 2*: the ESR wordmark, and that paper's
  four-panel labelled CT figure. Seven images, 239 KB, no licence, `docProps/app.xml` still naming
  the article. PR #335 had just built a gate to stop exactly this — and it globbed the filesystem,
  where a `.pptx` is one opaque binary. It printed *"OK: all 8 bundled image(s) may be shipped"*.
  The file is removed; nothing is lost, because `--template` has always accepted an absolute path
  and the journal profile already told users to download it. `check_bundled_media_license.py` now
  opens every OOXML container. It ignores `docProps/thumbnail.jpeg` — PowerPoint renders that from
  the deck's own slides, so counting it would fire on a contributor's brand-new original template,
  and a gate that fires on good work gets switched off.
- **The `LICENSE` described a different package from the one we shipped.** It said CONSORT and
  SPIRIT were *"NOT bundled due to license restrictions (CC BY-NC / CC BY-NC-ND)"* while the package
  shipped both — the summaries and the guideline authors' own `.docx` files. The 2025 updates
  relicensed to **CC BY 4.0**, so we were entitled to ship them all along; that is luck, not
  diligence. The third-party index now lists what is actually there, with each licence and citation,
  and `scripts/check_third_party_index.py` holds it to the tree in both directions: a file we swear
  we do not bundle must be absent, and a third-party payload we do ship must be declared.

### Added

- `scripts/check_third_party_index.py` + `tests/test_bundled_media_license.sh` — the self-test PR
  #335 never wrote. It does not check that the gates pass; it restores each defect (an image hidden
  in a container, a loose image with no provenance, a file the LICENSE denies shipping, an
  undeclared payload) and asserts the gate **fails**, and that it stays silent on work that is ours.

- **Two guards existed for one instance of a pattern and not for its twin.** Both were found by
  asking, of an existing gate, "what else looks exactly like this, and is it watched?"

  **A vendored set nothing checked.** Six risk-of-bias checklists (`RoB2`, `NOS`, `ROBINS_I`,
  `QUADAS2`, `PROBAST`, `PRISMA_DTA`) are vendored byte-identical from `/check-reporting` into
  `/meta-analysis` — the same build-time vendoring pattern as the 23 domain probes, which *are*
  gated by `check_domain_probe_sync.py`. The checklists were gated by nothing. No drift had happened
  yet, so nothing was broken; a hand-edit to either copy would have shipped two silently different
  versions of the same appraisal tool. The gate is now **table-driven** (`VENDOR_SETS`) and covers
  both sets — and, so a *third* set cannot be forgotten the same way, it hashes everything under
  `skills/` and **fails on byte-identical content living in two skills that no entry declares**. The
  table no longer has to be remembered, because an undeclared duplicate gets found. `--sync` still
  repairs drift in one command. (`/check-reporting`, `/meta-analysis`, `/peer-review`, `/self-review`)

  **A shipped, CI-tested script no skill ever ran.** `sync-submission/scripts/assemble_supplement.py`
  (199 lines) — supplement index↔file integrity, duplicate/skipped `S{N}` detection, `_combined.md`
  rebuild, callout coverage — was invoked by **no SKILL.md**. Its only caller was its own test. It had
  a CI step, a manifest entry, a CHANGELOG line and a README mention; none of those make a script run.
  Same disease as the five dormant detectors of #334, one category over: `check_detector_reachability.py`
  guards the detector glob, and the "deliberately not named `check_*` so the catalog won't count it"
  convention had quietly become an exemption from being used at all. It is now **Gate 14** of
  `/sync-submission` (the supplement numbering lock, run before freeze), and the new
  **`scripts/check_script_reachability.py`** (CI) fails if *any* script under `skills/*/scripts/` is
  unreachable from a SKILL.md — resolving cross-skill shell-outs and same-directory Python imports,
  because `from _yaml_frontmatter import …` contains no filename and a naive grep would report live
  helpers as dead code. Run-once authoring tools stay exempt only via a `MAINTAINER_TOOLS` allowlist
  that must name where each is documented, and the gate verifies the doc really mentions it.
  (`/sync-submission`)

  Both gates ship a self-test that **restores the real defect** and asserts failure — a drifted
  vendored checklist, and `assemble_supplement.py` with its SKILL.md step removed — plus negative
  fixtures proving they stay silent on good work (`/meta-analysis`'s local-only `JBI_Case_Series.md`;
  an import-only helper; a shelled-out script). Taxonomy and wiring rules recorded in
  `skills/MAINTENANCE.md` §3b/§3c. Detector count unchanged (repo-level gates are not detectors).
- **A fixture that is clean for one detector was not required to be clean for the others — and two
  detectors had already contradicted each other in that gap** (`scripts/check_detector_crossfire.py`,
  `tests/test_detector_crossfire.sh`). `check_slide_tells` treated a text block as an *arrow label*
  only if it was **≤ 18 pt**, while `check_deck_budget` demanded **≥ 20 pt** so the back row could
  read it. A legible 20-pt arrow label therefore satisfied the budget check and was **invisible** to
  the arrow check, so a well-made slide was reported as having unlabelled arrows. **Neither detector
  was wrong alone.** One detector's advisory threshold had quietly become another detector's
  *definition of a category*, and nothing in the repo ever looked at the two together.

  Every detector was tested only against fixtures built to its own model of the world, so this class
  of bug was invisible to every existing test. The new gate runs **every detector of a family against
  every clean fixture of that family** — all manuscript detectors across the three demo manuscripts,
  both deck detectors across all three clean decks the challenge cards build — and fails if any of
  them produces a finding. When one does, either the detector is over-firing or the demo is
  defective, and a human has to say which. **78 pairs** run today; the count is printed and a run of
  zero pairs is itself a failure, because a test that silently exercises nothing is worse than none.

  It found a real defect on its first run: **demo 02 had no Data Availability statement** (demos 01
  and 03 both do), which `check_disclosure_availability` hard-blocks. The demo is fixed, not the
  detector.

  The gate learns how to invoke each detector from its own `--help` rather than guessing, and it
  **never passes an output flag** (`--out` / `--json` / `--report`) — both deck detectors take
  `--json PATH`, and a guessing scanner once overwrote 31 fixtures that way. It also runs each
  detector with its working directory inside a temp dir (some write a *default* `qc/…` report beside
  the fixture) and hashes every fixture before and after, voiding the run if one changed. Detectors
  that need an input the fixture cannot supply are **skipped out loud, by name**, so the coverage is
  auditable.
- **Fifteen SKILL.md phases were billing every invocation for text most runs never read**
  (`scripts/check_phase_budget.py`, CI-enforced; `tests/test_phase_budget.sh`). A SKILL.md is
  loaded **in full** the moment its skill is invoked — before the agent knows what the user wants.
  The project already had the rule (*any phase over 80 lines gets extracted to `references/`,
  leaving a trigger table and a load-on-demand pointer* — it is why `/present-paper` Phase 0 went
  from ~14,000 tokens to ~6,700). Nothing enforced it, so it quietly stopped applying.

  The worst offender was `/write-paper` **Phase 7: Polish at 270 lines**, and `/write-paper`
  **Phase 0 at 127** — read *before the skill knows the paper type*, yet carrying full Case Report
  and Case Series modes that a manuscript can only ever need one of. Also split: `/self-review`
  Phase 2 (209), 2.5f (176), 2.5b (119), 2.5a (90), 2.5d (87); `/meta-analysis` Phase 4 (174) and
  Phase 3 (135); `/design-study` Phase 2 (146, whose 85-line reader-elicitation section applies
  only to studies with a human-rater arm); `/check-reporting` Step 5 (128, almost entirely output
  templates); `/add-journal` 3.2 (117, a single fill-in template); `/manage-project init` (109, a
  directory tree the init script already writes); `/make-figures` Study-Type Figure Sets (104);
  `/peer-review` Phase 3 (86).

  Each keeps its control flow, its gate invocations, and every HALT condition inline — what the
  agent needs *before* it knows the ask — and moves the reference material behind a trigger table
  that states what a blind read costs. **No exemptions were needed** (`EXEMPT` ships empty).

  The gate is **fence-aware**, and that is not cosmetic: a `## heading` inside a code fence is an
  output template, not a section boundary. A fence-blind parser chopped `/write-paper` Phase 7 in
  two at an embedded log-block template and reported it as 139 lines, and let four more over-budget
  sections hide the same way — so a long phase could evade the budget simply by containing one.
  The self-test pins this, and regresses the real defect: the 209-line `/self-review` Phase 2 is
  frozen byte-for-byte in `tests/fixtures/phase_budget/`, and the gate must still fail on it.

  Also repointed a dangling `/write-paper` reference (`references/check_xref_symptoms.md`, a file
  that never existed) at the reference that now carries the cross-reference fix routes.

### Added

- **`/self-review` — every analysis you report must have been defined**
  (`skills/self-review/scripts/check_analysis_definitions.py`, detector #66, with a challenge card).

  Twenty-four detectors in this skill ask whether a number is *correct*. **None asked whether the
  analysis that produced it was ever *defined*** — and a reviewer walks straight into that gap:

  > "The outcome (dependent variable) for the multivariable Cox model is not specified." … "The ground
  > truth (reference standard) against which discrimination and calibration were assessed is not
  > defined." … "This section is largely incomprehensible in its current form."

  A Cox model whose dependent variable is never stated is not a *hard* paper. It is an **incomplete**
  one. The gate emits `MODEL_OUTCOME_UNDEFINED`, `MODEL_NOT_IN_METHODS`, `REFERENCE_STANDARD_UNDEFINED`
  (Major) and `TIER_LABEL_UNDEFINED` (Minor).

  **`ANALYSIS_LOAD` is informational and never a verdict.** The same reviewer wrote *"too many analyses
  have been performed and reported"* — and named the mechanism in the next sentence: *"this appears to
  have contributed to omissions of critical information in the Materials and Methods section."* A second
  reviewer of the same manuscript listed its sensitivity analyses as a **strength**. So **load is the
  cause, not the crime**, and a detector that capped the count would have punished the strength and
  missed the defect. The two challenge fixtures carry the **identical** analysis count (two model
  families, two auxiliary analyses) and get opposite verdicts: definition is what the gate reads.

  The remedy is not to cut analyses. It is to restore the definitions they crowded out — and, where load
  is genuinely high, to move the defensive analyses to the supplement: same defence, far less reader
  burden and far less attack surface.

- **`/peer-review` — the request-type rule now has a script behind it**
  (`skills/peer-review/scripts/check_review_request_types.py`, detector #65, with a challenge card).
  **Every other detector in this repo audits the manuscript. This one audits the review.**

  Phase 3 already told reviewers to sort each ask into two kinds — **disclosure** ("show what the
  study already knows and has not printed": costs the authors nothing, and *surfaces* errors) and
  **computation** ("produce a number that does not yet exist": creates a new, unreviewed error
  surface, written under revision deadline by authors who will not re-check it, and accepted next
  round by a reviewer who reads its *existence* as compliance). In the incident that produced the
  rule, three of the four defects found in a revision had been **manufactured by the reviewer's own
  two computation requests**.

  **The rule shipped as prose, and prose did not bind.** In the first live review after it landed, a
  draft went out with fifteen asks — six computation, one demanding a second reader — and it passed
  *every* neighbouring gate: word count, em-dash density, forbidden recommendation words, attitude
  markers, hedging ratio. Those held because they are scripts. This one failed because it was a
  sentence. The difference was not importance; it was executability.

  The gate emits `COMPUTATION_UNJUSTIFIED` (a computation request stating no reason the existing
  tables cannot answer it — *feasibility is not justification*: "a text filter on data you already
  hold" says the work is cheap, not that the tables cannot answer it), `COMPUTATION_HEAVY`,
  `NEW_DATA_REQUESTED` (a second reader, re-segmentation, a new cohort — strictly worse, because it
  cannot be satisfied in a revision at all), `NESTED_P_REQUESTED` (never *request* the subset-vs-parent
  table that `check_nested_group_comparison.py` exists to flag), and `ESTIMATOR_UNNAMED`.

  Deliberately high-precision: it honours negation ("I am not asking you to repeat the validation";
  "a single reader **without** adjudication"; "**without** a significance test — the groups are
  nested") and ignores plain description ("bootstrap intervals are reported for the median only"
  states a fact, it does not ask for work). A detector that never falsely accuses a disclosure
  request is worth more than one that catches every computation.

  Wired into Phase 3 (beside the rule it enforces), Phase 4 self-QC item 7, and the Phase 6
  pre-submission checklist.

- **`/present-paper` — presentation archetypes: the skeleton, chosen by where you are standing**
  (`references/presentation_archetypes.md`, and its mechanical half `check_deck_budget.py`,
  detector #64). A deck has **two independent choices**, and conflating them is why talks fail: the
  **archetype** is what the talk has to *do*; the **visual style** is what it *looks like*. The skill
  had five skins and no skeletons. Now it has eight — conference oral, journal-club critique,
  case-anchored grand rounds, didactic lecture, defence/job talk, keynote (Duarte's sparkline, the
  Jobs STAR moment, Takahashi and Lessig), lay talk, and the decision brief (Minto's pyramid, action
  titles, Kawasaki's 10/20/30) — each with what the room is, what a slide is *for* there, what to
  steal, and what fails.

  A conference oral in a keynote's skeleton dies (no data on the slides; the reviewer in row three
  came for the numbers). A keynote in a conference oral's skeleton dies harder. **The skin is a
  preference; the skeleton is not.**

  `check_deck_budget.py --archetype X --minutes N` enforces the mechanical part — slides against the
  clock, words per slide, the type floor for the back row. It takes an archetype instead of a
  universal threshold **because a single global number would have to be wrong for most venues**:
  40 words is an ordinary academic slide and a catastrophic keynote slide. The challenge card proves
  exactly that, by judging *the same deck* twice and requiring opposite verdicts.

  Honest about evidence: **assertion-evidence is the only pattern here with experimental support**
  (Alley & Neeley 2005). The rest is craft — good craft, from people who are very good at this, but
  craft, and the file says so.

- **`/present-paper` — the marks an AI leaves on a deck, caught in the built `.pptx`**
  (`check_slide_tells.py`, detector #63). Reviewers now say roughly a third of the decks they
  receive were made by an AI, that they can spot it instantly, and — the part that matters — that
  the tell is **not that the deck is ugly**. Templates solved ugly. The tell is that the deck stops
  communicating: *"무슨 말을 하고 싶은 것인지 전달이 잘 안 된다. 만드는 사람의 생각을 잘 읽을 수가
  없음."* Investors are telling founders never to use AI for an IR deck. Six verdicts, each one a
  mark people name unprompted:

  | | |
  |---|---|
  | `CHROME_ON_EVERY_SLIDE` | the little words along the top and bottom of every slide |
  | `SCAFFOLD_PHRASE` | a slide narrating its own construction — "요약하자면", "The key takeaway is…" |
  | `TOPIC_TITLE` | a content slide titled "Results" instead of saying what the result was |
  | `SHAPE_MONOTONY` | the same rounded box, eight times, at the same size |
  | `DEAD_SPACE_BAND` | a mostly-empty slide with a hole through the middle |
  | `ARROW_NO_SEMANTICS` | two or more arrows and not one of them labelled |

  Stdlib-only (it reads the `.pptx` as the ZIP of XML it is), so it also audits a deck a colleague
  sends you. It does **not** detect "was AI used" — AI used as a booster leaves none of these marks.

- **`references/ai_slide_tells.md`** — the teaching half, read before drafting. Scaffolding is the
  centre of it: a person thinking A→B→C→D does it in silence and writes down **D**; a model says
  *"having completed B, I will now proceed to C"* and leaves the sentence in. Scaffolding is what a
  writer takes down in revision. AI hands over the building with the scaffolding still bolted on.

- **Diagrams and plots are now drawn as CODE and inserted** — matplotlib, or Graphviz DOT where the
  graph is the point, because a DOT edge *must* be written `A -> B [label="seeds along"]`: the
  language will not let you draw an unlabelled arrow. Assembling a diagram from `python-pptx`
  autoshapes produces both remaining tells at once and is now forbidden. This is the one approach
  practitioners report actually working when they hand slide-making to an agent.

### Fixed

- **Three detectors were counted, tested, released — and never ran.** `check_table_percentages`,
  `check_reported_p_from_counts` and `check_dta_denominators` shipped in v5.20.0 with challenge cards,
  CI steps, JSON envelopes and a release note, and **`self-review/SKILL.md` never mentioned them**.
  They passed every gate we had and had never once run on a manuscript, while being counted in the
  number we publish. A challenge card proves a detector **works**; nothing proved the skill **calls**
  it. They are now wired into Phase 2.5 — the arithmetic a reviewer redoes with a calculator: a
  percentage that does not follow from its own denominator, and a P value that does not follow from
  its own counts. `scripts/check_detector_reachability.py` (CI) now fails if any detector is not
  invoked by a SKILL.md, directly or through a named bundle runner.

- **`/present-paper` Phase 0 demanded ~14,000 tokens of references before a single slide.** Three of
  the six mattered up front; `medical_presentation_templates.md` alone cost ~3,700 tokens to use a
  fifth of, and the visual-style file was read before the style was chosen. Split into *read now*
  (the AI-tells file, the archetypes, the enforceable rules) and *read when Q0/Q2 tells you which
  one*. **~7,400 tokens saved per invocation, with nothing decision-shaping removed.**

- **The archetypes file duplicated the medical templates.** Archetypes A–D (conference oral, critique,
  case-anchored, didactic) are the same four venues the content templates already covered — two files
  answering "how do I structure a journal club talk". The boundary is now explicit: the archetype
  gives the **stance** (what the talk must do, what fails), the template gives the **sections**, and
  the archetype wins where they conflict. A section list cannot tell you that a journal club which
  merely summarises the paper has failed.
- **An MIT-licensed package was redistributing ten figures cropped from published papers.** Under
  `make-figures/references/exemplar_diagrams/`, ten PNGs were — in the directory README's own words —
  *"rendered figure cropped from a published paper"*. The README promised each carried a sidecar
  recording *"source PDF, page, DOI, crop coords"*, and that it *"records DOI and source for every
  exemplar."* **It recorded `label`, `figure_type`, `dpi`.** No source, no DOI, no licence; eight of
  the eighteen images had no sidecar at all. The safeguard the README described had never been
  implemented, and nothing checked. Its fair-use argument — that exemplars are *"not redistributed as
  part of generated figures"* — was true and beside the point: they were redistributed **as part of
  the package**, on npm and in the classroom ZIP every user downloads, under a licence that grants
  the world the right to copy, modify and sell them. Some were probably open-access and reusable with
  credit; we cannot say which, because the provenance was never recorded, and **a permission you
  cannot demonstrate is not a permission.**

  The ten are removed. The `_why.md` design notes stay — they are ours, and they are where the value
  was: a paragraph on why a two-tone palette survives greyscale teaches more than the picture it was
  written about. Three things now prevent a recurrence:

  - **`scripts/check_bundled_media_license.py` (CI)** — every raster image under `skills/` must be
    either generated by a named script of ours or carry a sidecar declaring `source`/`doi` **and** a
    redistributable `license`. No "probably fine" tier: the whole failure was a probably-fine nobody
    checked.
  - **`extract_exemplar_from_pdf.py` now requires `--doi` and a new `--license`.** `--doi` used to be
    optional, which is exactly how ten unattributable figures got in. A tool that *can* produce an
    unattributable exemplar eventually will.
  - The directory README says plainly what happened, and how to keep your own exemplars **locally**
    (a file you never commit is never redistributed).

  Payload: **13 MB → 1.1 MB.** Our own rendered exemplars were also downsampled to 1568 px — the
  ceiling the vision pipeline applies before a model ever sees them — so the removed pixels cost
  bandwidth and reached nobody. Verified by reading a compressed diagram back: every count and label
  in the PRISMA flow is still crisp.

- **A broken workflow file does not turn a pull request red — it makes the checks *disappear*.**
  A step named ``- name: Run deck-budget challenge (same deck: fits an oral, ...)`` put a `: ` inside
  an unquoted YAML scalar. `validate.yml` stopped being valid YAML, GitHub ran **zero jobs**, and
  `gh pr checks` said **"no checks reported on the branch"** — not a failure, just silence. Every
  gate in the repository (the PII scanner, the detector-envelope contract, the manifest, all 153
  steps) was quietly not running, and the branch looked *quiet* rather than *broken*. Anyone merging
  on green would have merged on nothing. `scripts/check_workflow_yaml.py` now parses every workflow
  file — and names that specific trap — as the first step of CI. It was verified by restoring the
  defect and watching the gate go red.

- **Our own house style was manufacturing the most-cited tell.** `academic-lecture-style.md` required
  an all-caps eyebrow on **every** slide and a `2026 · NEUROGENETICS` brand footer on **every**
  slide; `nature_lancet.md` gave them fixed coordinates; and `build_pptx_nature_lancet.py` took
  `eyebrow` as a **required** argument, so every content slide got one whether or not it meant
  anything. *"슬라이드 상단과 하단에 자잘한 글자들"* is the first thing reviewers name. Chrome is now
  off by default — the page number stays (someone in Q&A says "go back to twelve"), the eyebrow
  survives on the title slide and section dividers, and the rest is gone. **The builder was changed,
  not just the style guide**: editing the guide would have been a fix that changed nothing, because
  the builder is what makes the deck. `tests/test_builder_no_chrome.py` builds with the shipped
  builder (must be clean) *and* restores the old eyebrow-everywhere default (must be caught) — the
  second half is what makes the first half mean anything.

- **`check_detector_envelopes.py` failed a detector for doing the right thing.** It grepped source
  for the literal `"detector": "check_x"`, so a detector that names itself once
  (`DETECTOR = "check_x"`) and uses the constant in both the envelope and every finding was reported
  as not self-identifying. That would have pushed authors toward copy-pasted string literals to
  appease a checker, which is how a gate starts making the code worse. It now accepts both, and
  still catches a wrong name.

### Added

- **A setup check that answers "what else does this computer need?" before you need it**
  (`installers/doctor.py`; double-click `check-setup-macos.command` / `check-setup-windows.cmd`).
  Every skill that needs an outside program already fails politely — the problem is *when*: you find
  out in the middle of the work, and a clinician who hits that message does not stop and install a
  package manager. They close the window. The check runs at the end of every install and reports in
  terms of what you were trying to **do** — "turn your manuscript into a journal-formatted Word file"
  needs pandoc, "read and QC submission PDFs" needs poppler, "open a .docx at all" needs python-docx
  — and with `--fix` installs the small things after asking. Large things (a TeX distribution, R,
  PyTorch) are **never** installed for you: it prints the size and the command and leaves the choice
  alone. It installs nothing on its own, and cannot fail an install that worked.

- **The installers now offer to install Python itself.** Telling someone with no Python to "go to
  python.org" is a step they have to perform; on Windows the installer now offers
  `winget install --exact --id Python.Python.3.13 --scope user` — no administrator password, which
  matters on a locked-down hospital PC — and otherwise opens the download page for them, on both
  platforms. The one checkbox that breaks everything if missed ("Add python.exe to PATH") is called
  out.

### Fixed

- **We invited contributors through the browser, then failed them with a Python script.** A
  stranger's first pull request — five nephrology journal profiles, exactly what our "good first
  issue" asked for — went red with `DISTRIBUTION_MANIFEST_DRIFT: … out of date — run python3
  scripts/gen_distribution_manifest.py`. He had added ten shipped files, so the hashed inventory the
  self-updater verifies against no longer matched. Nothing was wrong with his work. But CONTRIBUTING
  promises a browser-only path with **no git and no terminal**, and someone who accepts that
  invitation cannot run a Python script: we told them to do the one thing we had just promised they
  would never have to do. The gate stays strict — it protects the updater — but it now **names the
  files that moved**, gives the command, and says plainly that a contributor who cannot run it should
  leave it red, because **a maintainer will refresh the manifest before merging and this is not a
  rejection**. CONTRIBUTING says the same. A regression test adds a shipped file and asserts the
  message, because the message was the defect.

- **The README demanded R and never mentioned pandoc — both wrong.** It listed "R 4.0+ with `meta`,
  `metafor`, `mada`" under Requirements, which reads as *you cannot use this without R*. The toolkit
  **never executes R**: `/analyze-stats` writes Python unless asked for R. Meanwhile **pandoc** — which
  people genuinely hit, because it renders the manuscript to Word — was not listed at all. Requirements
  now says what is true: Python and an agent host, and everything else on demand.

- **The Windows installer could report success while installing nothing.** On a Windows machine with
  no Python, `python` still *exists*: it is an App Execution Alias that opens the Microsoft Store. So
  `where python` succeeded, the installer ran it, a Store page opened — and the script said it was
  done. **Windows is 65% of classroom-ZIP downloads.** An interpreter is now accepted only after it
  proves, **by running**, that it is Python 3.9 or newer; asking `where` only proves a name exists.

- **A too-old Python produced a traceback instead of an explanation.** `install.py` *parses* on 3.8,
  so it did not fail cleanly — it died partway through and left a clinician staring at a Python stack
  trace. All four double-click scripts (install / update × macOS / Windows) and both Python entry
  points now check the floor **before** anything runs, and say which of the two problems it is ("no
  Python" and "too old a Python" need different actions), what to do about it, and that nothing on the
  computer was changed. A failed install now also says so, rather than ending on a cheerful prompt.

- **`check_python_floor.py` (CI)**: every script that reaches a user — the installers and the skill
  scripts the agent runs on their machine — must parse on **Python 3.9**, the floor the README
  promises. CI runs 3.11 and this project is developed on 3.14, so a `match` statement would have
  shipped, broken only on a clinician's computer, and been invisible: when a research tool errors out,
  a physician does not file a bug. They close the window and go back to doing it by hand.

### Added

- **`/contribute` — the way back** (new skill; **56 skills**, **detectors 61 → 62**). The people who use
  this toolkit are clinicians. They install it once, adapt a skill to the way their department actually
  works, add the journal they publish in, fix a checklist item that was wrong for their specialty — and
  then stop. The edit sits on one laptop. They do not open a pull request, because a pull request is not
  a thing they do. Frequently that edit is the most valuable thing in the repository, because it is real
  domain knowledge nobody in the project has, and it dies where it was written.

  The detection already existed and nobody had noticed: the installer hashes every shipped file and takes
  a **permanent backup** of any skill you modified before overwriting it. Nothing ever read the backup
  again. `/contribute` is the other half — it compares the installed skills against the shipped hashes,
  tells the author exactly what they changed and added, and offers it back as a pull request **without
  them ever typing a git command**. No GitHub CLI? It reaches the project as a pre-filled issue instead;
  installing a developer tool is not made a condition of helping.

  **`check_contribution_safety.py` is the load-bearing part.** These users edit skills *while working on
  real manuscripts and real patients*, so a local edit can carry a patient identifier, a national ID, an
  IRB number, a manuscript under review, a colleague's name, or a home directory with their own account
  name in it. A contribution flow that simply uploads "the files you changed" is a PHI leak with a
  friendly button on it. Patient-level data and credentials are **blockers** — the line is deleted, not
  argued with — and identity, institution, approval-ID, manuscript-ID and local-path findings are shown
  with the remedy next to them.

  And the skill says out loud, every time, that **the scan is not a certificate**: no pattern list
  recognises every patient name or every hospital, and a scanner that is *believed* to be complete is
  more dangerous than none, because it replaces the human check. The author reads every line that would
  leave their machine, and confirms, or nothing is sent.

  It also files the feedback that is not a code change — *"this flagged my paper and it was wrong"*, *"this
  failed on my Word document"*. A false positive is the only evidence anyone has of how a detector behaves
  on a **real** manuscript rather than a synthetic fixture; it is not a lesser contribution.

  **And nobody is nagged.** Reminders are **opt-in and off by default** — a clinician installed a
  research tool, they did not sign up to be asked for things, and an installer that greets a physician
  mid-manuscript with *"you changed a file, would you like to share it?"* is an installer they stop
  running, which this audience already under-does. Defaulting to silence costs a few contributions;
  defaulting to noise costs the update path itself.

  The install also, **once**, says how to say thanks — because clinicians who find this useful write
  to the maintainer personally and have often never starred the repository, not having weighed it up
  and declined but never having been told that starring is the thing you do, what it is for, or that
  it takes one click. That is a **missing instruction, not a missing favour**. `star_repo.py` explains
  what a star is (how the next researcher with the same problem finds the tool; the closest thing
  research software has to a citation when it is not in anyone's reference list) and then makes it one
  command with the GitHub CLI, or one click without it. If they have already starred it, it says thank
  you and stops. It never asks twice.

  The contribution option is mentioned **once**, at the end of a first install, and then never again whatever the
  user does — *ignoring the question is an answer*. Opted in, the reminder appears only when something
  actually changed, and **at most once a month**. The setting governs reminders **only** (`/contribute`
  runs whenever it is run; turning reminders off is not opting out of contributing, it is opting out of
  being asked), and it **cannot weaken the safety scan**, which reads no configuration at all — the
  tests assert that.


## [5.21.0] - 2026-07-13

Verification-layer batch: the marked-manuscript round trip, a self-improvement probe, an artifact
contract that lets a qc file name the detector that wrote it, two `/verify-refs` precision defects,
and `/find-cohort-gap` opened to researchers who do not have a named public cohort.
**55 skills / 61 integrity detectors / 46 guidelines / 23 domain-probe modules.**

### Added

- **A domain probe + gate for manuscripts that claim a system improved *itself*** (`/peer-review` +
  `/self-review`, `self_improving_system.md` SI1–SI7 and `check_self_improvement_claims.py`;
  **detectors 60 → 61**, domain probes 22 → 23). An agent that critiques and rewrites its own reports, a
  pipeline fine-tuned on data it generated, an LLM used as the judge that scores the training signal — a
  fast-growing class in medical AI, and one that is reviewed badly, because the loop *looks* like a
  method while the thing that decides whether it worked is often the system itself.

  The probe's organizing question is not *did it improve?* but **what said so?** Every improvement loop
  is a claim that some signal can substitute for human judgment, and signals are not interchangeable: a
  formal verifier is sound by construction; execution feedback is reliable but incomplete; an
  LLM-as-judge is bounded by its own competence and is itself an optimization target; a model's own
  confidence is the most gameable of all. Demonstrated self-improvement tracks that order, so a rung-1
  conclusion drawn from a rung-3 signal is a design-level Major.

  Two of the seven probes are decidable by reading, and the detector takes them:
  `SELF_CONFIRMING_EVALUATOR` (the judge is the same model family as the system it judges, and is never
  validated against anything outside the loop — when generator and evaluator share weights their biases
  correlate, and the loop reinforces the errors the model is *most confident about*) and
  `UNGROUNDED_SELF_LOOP` (an explicit self-refinement claim with no external signal named anywhere;
  ungrounded self-critique converges to rewording, not correction). Plus `SELF_TRAINING_NO_REAL_DATA`
  (minor) for training on generated data with no real-data mixing, where the distribution's tails — the
  rare presentations — are what erodes first.

  It is deliberately conservative: a paper that self-refines **and** validates its judge against human
  experts or a held-out labelled set has named its signal and does not fire. From there the probes are
  judgment, and stay judgment.

  Framework and evidence: Chen, Wang & Qu, *Recursive Self-Improvement in AI* (arXiv:2607.07663, a
  survey of 1,250 papers) for the verification hierarchy and the self-confirming loop; DeVilling, *The
  Mirror Loop* (arXiv:2510.21861) for the measured 55% decline in informational change across ten rounds
  of ungrounded self-critique; Shumailov et al., *Nature* 2024, for collapse under self-generated
  training data.

- **Complete / quasi-complete separation is caught before the model is fitted** (`/analyze-stats`
  Phase 2, `check_separation.py`; **detectors 59 → 60**). A predictor that perfectly predicts the
  outcome breaks maximum likelihood — no finite MLE exists — and the failure is **silent**. `glm`
  does not error: it returns an odds ratio of 0.00 (or an enormous one), *p* ≈ 0.99, and an AUC.
  That AUC gets written into a table as a result.

  This is routine in diagnostic imaging, because the good signs are the pathognomonic ones. A sign
  with 100% specificity and 100% PPV — T2-FLAIR mismatch for IDH status, the string sign, a halo
  sign — has an empty cell against the outcome *by construction*. Enter it as a covariate in an
  incremental-value model and the model is numerically undefined while looking entirely healthy.

  The gate is a cross-tabulation, not an inference: an empty cell is arithmetic, and arithmetic can
  be checked in advance. It runs on the **data**, in the analysis-plan phase, and reports
  `COMPLETE_SEPARATION` (an empty cell, or a continuous predictor whose ranges do not overlap) and
  `QUASI_SEPARATION` (a cell below the sparsity floor, where the estimate converges but its CI is
  not trustworthy).

  Both verdicts name **both** remedies, because the choice is a study-design decision and not a
  numerical one: Firth's penalised likelihood keeps a single model, while a **two-stage rule** —
  classify the sign-positive cases directly, model only the sign-negative remainder — is usually the
  clinically meaningful design for a pathognomonic sign, since a sign-positive patient is already
  diagnosed and the real question is what to do with everyone else.

- **Publisher markup in a `.bib` title is now caught before it renders** (`/manage-refs`,
  `check_bib_title_markup.py`; **detectors 58 → 59**). CrossRef ships titles containing markup —
  `<scp>WHO</scp>`, `<i>IDH</i>`, `<sub>1</sub>` — and a DOI-add stores them verbatim. Better BibTeX
  then either escapes the tags (`{$<$}scp{$>$}`) or strips them without restoring the space they
  occupied, and the reference list prints as garbage: *"The 2021 {$<$}scp{$>$}WHO{$<$}/scp{$>$}
  Classification…"*, *"Glioma Groups Based on 1p/19q,IDH, andTERTPromoter Mutations"*.

  Nothing caught this. `/verify-refs` checks whether a reference is **true**; `check_citation_keys`
  checks whether its key **resolves**; neither looks at the title as it will be **printed** — so the
  corruption survived every green gate and was found by eyeballing the rendered document, which is
  exactly the reading nobody gives a reference list. The new gate joins the `pre_submission_gate.sh`
  chain, so it runs where the others already run.

  `TITLE_FUSION` is deliberately narrow — it fires on an English function word or a comma welded to
  an acronym, not on any lowercase-then-uppercase transition — so `mRNA`, `hTERT`, `nnU-Net`, `pH`
  and `1,2-dichloroethane` do not fire. A gate is only worth having if a clean run means something.

- **`/find-cohort-gap` accepts your own cohort** (issue #69, requested by an external user).
  The skill used to start from a *named* database — NHIS, UK Biobank, and the handful of registries it
  knows about. Most researchers do not have one of those: they have an institutional registry, a
  single-centre EMR export, or a specialty cohort, described by a data dictionary nobody else has ever
  seen. Those users could not use the skill at all.

  **`scripts/build_cohort_profile.py`** is the input layer that lets them in. It reads a local codebook
  (`.csv` / `.tsv` / `.json` / `.md` / `.txt`, plus `.xlsx` via openpyxl and `.pdf` via `pdftotext`) and
  emits the same cohort profile the skill already consumes, so the intersection matrix, saturation scan
  and 6-pattern scoring are unchanged. A review, guideline, or preprint can be attached as domain
  context (`--context`), as a file or a URL. A `.csv` is auto-detected as a codebook (rows are
  variables) or a data export (the header row is the variable list).

  It is a script and not "the model reads the file" for a reason: asked to *summarise* a codebook, a
  language model will paraphrase a variable name, merge two that look alike, or invent one the cohort
  does not have — and the intersection matrix, the feasibility gate, and eventually the manuscript's
  Methods all inherit it. So variables are **enumerated, never generated**: copied verbatim, each
  carrying its provenance (`file:row`). What the codebook cannot state — sample size, follow-up
  duration, IRB status, prior publications — is emitted as `[UNKNOWN - ask the user]` rather than
  guessed, because a fabricated N does not merely sit there; it flows into the Phase 5 feasibility gate,
  which then passes for a reason unrelated to the cohort.

  Two structural facts *are* derivable from variable names, and both feed patterns the skill already
  scores: **serial / repeated-measure groups** (P1 Longitudinal Advantage) and **endpoint candidates**
  (P2 Endpoint Upgrade). Endpoints also get a cluster of their own (`outcome_endpoint`), assigned only
  when no other cluster claims the variable — otherwise the profile contradicted itself, listing
  `death_date` as "matched nothing, review it" in the cluster map while citing it as the P2 evidence
  two sections below. Each is reported with the variables that justify it, and a measurement is only
  called serial when it genuinely repeats. Cluster assignment records the keyword that triggered it, and
  a variable matching nothing is left `unclassified` rather than forced into a bucket.

- **Marked (tracked-changes) manuscript: a build step and a round-trip gate** (`/sync-submission` Phase 10,
  used by `/revise`). Every revision round must ship the revised paper with tracked changes against the
  version the reviewers saw. This was the last hand-done, unverified step of a submission: produced by
  clicking through Word's Compare, then "checked" by grepping the file for a sentence or two that ought to
  appear as an insertion — a check that passes even when Compare has dropped a paragraph, duplicated one, or
  split the revisions between two authors.

  - **`check_marked_manuscript.py`** (new detector; **57 → 58**) verifies the marked file the only way that
    is correct by construction: **accepting every revision must reproduce the revised manuscript exactly, and
    rejecting every revision must reproduce the original**. Verdicts: `MARKED_ACCEPT_MISMATCH`,
    `MARKED_REJECT_MISMATCH`, `MARKED_NO_REVISIONS`, `MARKED_AUTHOR_MIXED`, `MARKED_TABLE_LOSS`,
    `MARKED_BASE_TRACKED`. Stdlib only, so it audits a marked file produced by any means, on any platform.
  - **The gate is move-aware.** Word encodes relocated content as `w:moveFrom` / `w:moveTo`, *not* as
    `w:ins` / `w:del`. A verifier that knows only insert-and-delete reconstructs the original with the moved
    paragraph in it twice, and reports a perfectly good file as corrupt — a false alarm confirmed against a
    real, already-submitted marked manuscript. Resolution: `revised = unchanged + w:ins + w:moveTo`;
    `original = unchanged + w:delText + w:moveFrom`.
  - **`build_marked_manuscript.py`** drives Word's Compare from the command line through AppleScript
    (`author name` is passed to Compare, so revisions are attributed at source instead of by rewriting
    `w:author` afterwards), optionally injects continuous line numbers, and runs the gate on its own output.
    macOS + Word only, and therefore deliberately *not* a detector. `pandiff` and LibreOffice `--compare`
    remain forbidden: they corrupt OOXML tables and superscript runs.
  - Detector hygiene, encoded once: docx text must be read by walking exact `w:t` / `w:delText` elements. The
    regex `<w:t[^>]*>` also matches `<w:tbl>`, `<w:tc>` and `<w:tr>`, silently swallowing table markup as prose.

- **Every detector's JSON artifact now names the detector that wrote it.** A verification layer
  whose artifacts cannot be traced back to the check that produced them is only half a verification
  layer. The `qc/*.json` envelopes carried the findings but not the finding's author, so a consumer
  aggregating a project's `qc/` directory — an audit trail, a dashboard, a precision ledger — had to
  infer the detector from the **filename**, which is chosen freely at the call site (`--out qc/cs3.json`,
  `--out qc/v13_scope.json`). Two runs of one detector under different filenames read as two detectors;
  one run under an unexpected filename read as none.

  All 56 JSON-emitting detectors now emit `"detector": "<id>"` in the envelope (a purely additive key —
  every existing consumer keeps working), and **`scripts/check_detector_envelopes.py`** enforces it in
  CI, so a new detector cannot ship without it and a cloned one cannot keep its parent's name. It is a
  source check, not an execution check: detectors need fixtures and sometimes a network to run, but the
  key is a literal and can be verified without either.

### Fixed

- **Two precision defects in `/verify-refs`'s author cross-check**, found on the same clean
  bibliography and failing in opposite directions.

  *A false alarm.* The surname normalizer folds accents but not Unicode **dashes**, and its final
  filter keeps `[a-z\s-]` and deletes everything else — so a publisher-supplied U+2010 in a
  hyphenated surname was *deleted* rather than matched. CrossRef's `Foltyn‐Dumitru` normalized to
  `foltyndumitru` while the identical ASCII bib entry gave `foltyn-dumitru`, and the audit fired
  `MISMATCH` — its loudest verdict, the one that means *fabricated author* — on a correct reference.
  Unicode dash variants now fold to ASCII first.

  *A false pass, which is worse.* Better BibTeX brace-protects a hyphenated or particle surname so
  BibTeX will not re-split it (`author = {{Eckel-Passow}, Jeanette E. and {von Deimling}, Andreas}`).
  The corporate-author heuristic treated **any** brace as an organization and **skipped the author
  cross-check entirely** — the one thing the tool exists to do — reporting `UNVERIFIED — corporate
  author` and moving on. A brace now signals an organization only when the field carries an
  organizational keyword or has no personal-name structure at all; genuine collective authors
  (`{{KDIGO Working Group}}`) are still skipped.

- **The locale-inventory gate no longer trips over build artifacts.** It scanned `__pycache__`, so a
  compiled `.pyc` of a Korean-bearing module — produced simply by running a test that imports it — was
  reported as an un-inventoried Korean file: a CI failure on a git-ignored file that does not ship and
  has nothing to fix.

- **The JOSS paper's detector total is now gated.** `paper.md` states the size of the detector suite in its
  Summary but was absent from `DETECTOR_CLAIM_FILES`, so it would have silently disagreed with the software
  it describes the moment the suite grew. Added to `scripts/validate_catalog_consistency.py`.

## [5.20.1] - 2026-07-11

Audit-driven fixes (no behaviour change to skills): a real `/orchestrate --e2e` state-transition bug
(the pipeline halted at step 3 requiring a DOCX only rendered at step 7), 20 skills made routable from the
single entry point with a CI reachability gate, and a README plugin-count that had drifted from the
marketplace SSOT (now gated). No new skill or detector; **55 skills / 46 guidelines / 57 integrity detectors**.

### Fixed

- **Public-claim plugin-count gate** (audit F/§6.1, PR-3) — the README plugin-marketplace claim was not
  cross-checked against the SSOT, so it drifted: README said "eight `medsci-*` category plugins" while
  `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` has nine (all `medsci-*`). Fixed to "nine", and extended
  `scripts/validate_catalog_consistency.py` to recompute the plugin count from the marketplace SSOT and
  assert the README claim (word or digit) matches — the same drift-guard the skills / guideline / detector
  counts already have. CI-enforced.

- **`/orchestrate` coherence** (audit F1 + F2) — two P0 findings from a repo-improvement audit.
  **F1 (E2E state transition):** the `--e2e` post-skill validation required `manuscript_final.docx` for
  `/write-paper`, but the DOCX is only rendered by `/manage-refs` at step 7, so an `--e2e` run halted at
  step 3 ("STOP, do not proceed"). `/write-paper` now validates only `manuscript.md`; the DOCX requirement
  stays on the `/manage-refs` row where it is produced. **F2 (reachability):** the hand-maintained
  "Available Skills" routing table listed 34 of 55 skills, so the single entry point could not route to the
  other 20 (most of the model-engineering lane: `architecture-zoo`, `preprocess-imaging`, `model-scaffold`,
  `radiomics-ml`, `model-validation`, `model-evaluation`, `mllm-eval`, `explainability`,
  `uncertainty-imaging`, `model-card`, plus `author-strategy`, `batch-cohort`, `cross-national`,
  `replicate-study`, `ma-scout`, `find-cohort-gap`, `design-ai-benchmarking`, `review-paper`,
  `polish-language`, `setup-medsci`). All 20 are added to the table, and a new
  `scripts/check_orchestrate_reachability.py` CI gate (with self-test) asserts every skill directory is
  routable from `/orchestrate` (or explicitly direct-only), so the drift cannot recur. No new skill or
  detector; catalog counts unchanged.

## [5.20.0] - 2026-07-11

Reviewer-arithmetic gates — five deterministic `self-review` detectors that recompute what a manuscript
already prints (an `n (%)` cell vs its column denominator; a subset-vs-parent-cohort P value; a row P from
2×2 counts via pure-stdlib Fisher / Pearson χ²; sensitivity/specificity denominators vs the reference-standard
category counts; median-difference parity), plus `/peer-review` request-type discipline (disclosure vs
computation) and impossibility-claim verification. Additive and backward-compatible;
**55 skills / 46 guidelines / 57 integrity detectors**.

### Changed

- **Reviewer request-type discipline + impossibility-claim verification** (`peer-review`, R2/R3/R4) — Phase 3
  now classifies every Major's ask as *disclosure* (the study already holds the answer — surfaces errors,
  costs nothing) vs *computation* (a number that does not yet exist — a new, unreviewed error surface); a
  computation request must justify that the existing tables cannot answer it and name its estimator, and a
  subset-vs-parent-cohort P value must never be requested (nested groups → invalid). Phase 4 item 14
  (verify-your-own-criticism) is widened to cover assertions of arithmetic/statistical *impossibility* from
  the manuscript's own summary statistics (restate as premise→conclusion + counterexample; a quantile/IQR
  does not constrain the tail, an agreement coefficient does not constrain the marginal), plus re-deriving a
  reviewer-requested new statistic before accepting it Resolved. The observational (`O10`) and
  diagnostic-accuracy (`D2`) domain probes gain the nested subset-vs-parent P-value invalidity rule (vendored
  byte-identical into `self-review`). Pairs with the D1/D4 deterministic gates and the `~/.claude/rules`
  R1/R5 updates. No new detector; catalog counts unchanged.

### Added

- **Reviewer-arithmetic detectors D1–D4** (`self-review`) — four deterministic gates promoted from a
  reviewer-side review cycle, each recomputing what a manuscript already prints:
  `check_nested_group_comparison.py` (`NESTED_GROUP_TEST` — a P-value table comparing an analysed subset
  against the parent cohort that contains it is an *invalid* test, not merely uninformative; the valid
  contrast is subset vs remainder), `check_reported_p_from_counts.py` (`P_NOT_REPRODUCIBLE` — rebuilds each
  2×2 row and recomputes Fisher / Pearson χ² ± Yates in pure stdlib, calibrates the family on rows that
  reproduce, and flags a reported P off by >1 order of magnitude under every family), `check_dta_denominators.py`
  (`DTA_DENOMINATOR_MISMATCH` / `STAGE_ROWSUM` — sensitivity/specificity denominators must equal the
  reference-standard category counts in the characteristics table; grand-total agreement is not accepted as
  passing), and `check_paired_difference_estimator.py` (`MEDIAN_PARITY` / `DEGENERATE_CI` / `ESTIMATOR_UNNAMED`
  — an odd-n integer-scale median cannot be non-integer, a zero-width CI, and an effect size with no named
  estimator). All run on first submissions, not only revisions; each ships a synthetic challenge card that runs
  in CI. Paired with rule updates R1 (requested-analysis correctness audit) and R5 (portal box-provenance) in
  `~/.claude/rules`. **Integrity detectors 53 → 57.**

- **Table-percentage gate** (`self-review`) — `check_table_percentages.py` recomputes every `n (p%)` table
  cell against its own column denominator (a `n = N` header, a Total row, or the column's counts summing)
  and flags a printed percentage off by more than 0.5 pp — the cheapest, zero-judgement arithmetic check,
  which routinely survives multiple review rounds because the error is present from the first submission
  (e.g. `79 (63%)` / `53 (37%)` under 132, true 59.8% / 40.2%). A column is treated as percentages only when
  a cell carries an explicit `%` or its parentheticals sum to ~100, so `mean (SD)` cells never false-fire.
  Sibling to `check_cohort_arithmetic`; challenge card runs in CI. **Integrity detectors 52 → 53.**

## [5.19.0] - 2026-07-11

Reviewer-safety + reporting-checklist batch — a PDF hidden-text / prompt-injection guard for
`/peer-review`, plus the TARGET (target-trial emulation) and REMARK (prognostic tumour-marker)
reporting checklists. Additive and backward-compatible; **55 skills / 46 guidelines / 52 integrity detectors**.

### Added

- **PDF hidden-text / prompt-injection guard** (`peer-review`) — a two-stage reviewer-safety tool for
  manuscripts that smuggle a review-steering instruction into the PDF where a human cannot see it but an
  LLM ingesting the text layer reads it (white-on-white text, sub-visible fonts, off-page glyphs, invisible
  render mode, or a document-metadata field; the injection attack first reported at scale in 2025).
  `scan_pdf_layers.py` (PyMuPDF) transcribes the PDF into a span manifest; the new stdlib-only detector
  `check_pdf_injection.py` audits the manifest, flags hidden runs and instruction-style phrases (HIGH inside
  a hidden run, LOW in visible prose), and emits the visible-only text (`--sanitize`) to feed an LLM instead
  of the raw PDF. A synthetic-manifest challenge card runs in CI without PyMuPDF. Guards the reviewer against
  an author's injection; it is unrelated to a venue's own canary text, and does not change the rule that the
  journal's LLM-use policy governs whether a confidential manuscript may be uploaded at all.
  **Integrity detectors 51 → 52.**

- **TARGET reporting checklist** (`check-reporting`) — Transparent Reporting of Observational Studies
  Emulating a Target Trial (Cashin, Hansford, Hernán et al. JAMA 2025;334(12):1084-1093). 21 items across
  6 sections, pairing the target-trial specification (item 6) with its emulation in the data (item 7) for
  each protocol element (eligibility, treatment strategies, assignment, time zero, outcome, causal
  contrast, assumptions, analysis). Routed via the study-type table + `target` / `targettrial` / `tte`
  aliases, with a TARGET critical-item floor (protocol-and-emulation specification, time-zero alignment /
  immortal-time control, causal estimand + identifying assumptions). Closes the design→reporting loop with
  the existing `/design-study` target-trial-emulation module. **Reporting guidelines 45 → 46.**

- **REMARK reporting checklist** (`check-reporting`) — REporting recommendations for tumour MARKer
  prognostic studies (McShane et al. Br J Cancer 2005; Altman et al. Explanation & Elaboration, PLoS
  Med 2012). 20 items across Introduction / Materials and Methods / Results / Discussion, vendored as a
  faithful own-words summary of item intent. Routed via the study-type table + `remark` / `tumormarker`
  aliases, with a REMARK critical-item floor (marker definition, cutpoint justification, multivariable
  adjustment for established prognostic variables, all-endpoint reporting). Fills the reporting-audit gap
  for prognostic tumor-marker / ctDNA-MRD studies (pair with STROBE for the observational-design items).
  **Reporting guidelines 44 → 45.**

## [5.18.0] - 2026-07-07

Reliability & workflow-integrity batch — a new deterministic gate for revision response letters, a
reframe/headline-change survivor scan, a pre-drafting backbone full-text gate, a skill-registry
consistency validator, plus AI-tool citation-framing guidance and the PneumoniaMNIST model-engineering
demo. Additive and backward-compatible; **55 skills / 44 guidelines / 51 integrity detectors**.

### Documentation

- **verify-refs guard hook — extended warn-only coverage (issue #14)**. The optional local PostToolUse
  hook (`~/.claude/hooks/verify-refs-guard.sh`, document-only in this repo) previously gated only
  `submission/` and `revision/R*/…circulation…` saves, so senior-mentor reply drafts and pre-submission
  `outgoing/` packages skipped the citation audit entirely. Documented (README + verify-refs manual-checkpoint
  guide) the added **warn-only** patterns — `*/outgoing/*.{docx,md}`, `*/8_Review_Comments/*/outgoing/*.{docx,md}`,
  and any `*/circulation/*.{docx,md}` — which surface a missing audit without blocking and never enforce,
  regardless of SSOT/migration state. Extends the local-only regression suite (`tests/test_phase1c_hooks.sh`)
  with a case asserting an `outgoing/` FABRICATED draft warns rather than blocks even under `MODE=enforce`.

- **AI-tool citation framing (`/academic-aio`)** — a use-class guide for citing an AI-assisted research
  tool safely (`references/ai_tool_citation_framing.md` + a Section 2.4a pointer). Verification/QA and
  analysis uses belong in a Software / Code-availability statement (citable, rigor-signalling); generative
  drafting belongs in the journal's AI-disclosure field, not a proud citation. Self-citation by a tool's
  author additionally requires a COI disclosure. States why a deterministic gate is deferred (use-class
  classification is high-FP without context). Motivated by the recurring "how do I cite an AI-QA tool
  under journal AI-hostility" question.

### Added

- **`make-figures` PPTX Mac-compatibility validator test** (`skills/make-figures/tests/test_pptx_mac_compat.py`).
  `validate_pptx_mac_compat.py` (TIFF media / `<a:sp3d>` bevel / `docProps/app.xml` slide-count mismatch /
  `srcRect` over-crop) previously shipped without a regression test. The test builds a clean deck
  (python-pptx, with a corrected app.xml slide count so the known `<Slides>0` bug does not false-fail),
  asserts it passes, then injects each of the four defect classes and asserts a `--strict` failure, plus a
  missing-input exit code and the WARN-tolerated (no app.xml) path. CI-wired. No skill-logic change.

- **Backbone full-text readiness gate for `/write-paper`** (`skills/write-paper/scripts/gate_backbone_fulltext.py`,
  issues #4 + #8). Phase 0 records a backbone article (`project.yaml::backbone_article`), but nothing forced
  its **full text** to be extracted before drafting — so the draft could follow an abstract. The gate resolves
  the backbone (via `project.yaml`, or `--backbone`, mapping citekey→DOI from `refs.bib`) and confirms an
  extracted Markdown full text exists and is substantial: `BACKBONE_FULLTEXT_MISSING` (nothing extracted),
  `BACKBONE_FULLTEXT_THIN` (below the full-text size floor — an abstract/landing page), or `BACKBONE_UNDECLARED`
  (warn). Wired into Phase 0 as a mandatory pre-drafting gate that routes to `/lit-sync` Phase 2.7 +
  `/fulltext-retrieval` `pdf_to_md.py`. A pre-draft **workflow prerequisite**, not a manuscript-integrity
  detector (named `gate_*`, not `check_*`) — **detector count unchanged (51)**. Ships
  `skills/write-paper/tests/test_backbone_fulltext.sh`.

- **Reframe / headline-change survivor scan** — `check_cross_artifact_stale.py` (sync-submission) gains
  opt-in `--retired-term` / `--old-value`. After a revision reframes a claim class or changes a headline
  number, stale copies survive in un-touched body paragraphs, figure/table legends, the supplement, and
  the response letter (which often claims the change was applied "throughout"). Given the retired
  vocabulary / superseded value(s), the gate scans the **body and every aux artifact** and flags each
  survivor (`retired_framing_survivor` / `stale_old_value`), automating the claim-site grep of
  `manuscript-versioning.md` §6.1 across all artifacts rather than a sample. Numeric survivors are
  digit-bounded (`1.72` never matches `11.723`). Additive — **no new detector, detector count unchanged**;
  extends the existing `test_cross_artifact_stale.sh` (11 cases). Demand-gated by recurrence across
  multiple projects (reframe drift + claim-site propagation).

- **Response-claim verification gate** (`skills/revise/scripts/check_response_claims.py`, integrity
  detectors **50 → 51**). A response-to-reviewers letter's *"we added the sentence '…'"* / *"we now
  cite Tariq et al. [15]"* is verified against the **revised manuscript body** — the source of truth,
  not the response prose. Fires `RESPONSE_QUOTE_UNVERIFIED` (a quoted added sentence absent from the
  body) and `RESPONSE_CITATION_UNVERIFIED` (an added citation whose token is nowhere in the body).
  Conservative by design: paraphrased edits and reviewer-comment blockquotes are not flagged, so a
  firing verdict is a real discrepancy. Wired into `/revise` (author, pre-send gate) and `/peer-review`
  (reviewer, verifying the author's claims), implementing the rule that a claimed-but-absent edit is a
  reputation-fatal class both a reviewer round and the authors can miss. Ships
  `skills/revise/tests/test_response_claims.sh`; `/revise` gains its first deterministic gate.

### Developer tooling

- **Skill-registry consistency validator** (`scripts/validate_capabilities.py`, CI-enforced, issue #15).
  Asserts that `capabilities.yml` (which adjudicates the overlapping domains) and every
  `skills/*/skill.yml` (`owner_domain`) agree: valid-YAML contracts, owner⇄skill agreement, no silent
  claimant of a declared domain, and resolvable `overlaps`/umbrella members. It found and fixed two
  latent drifts it now guards against — a malformed `render-pdf-doc/skill.yml` (an unquoted embedded
  colon that no prior check caught, because `validate_skill_contracts.py` parses skill.yml by regex and
  was never wired into CI) and `fulltext-retrieval` claiming the `literature_discovery` domain without
  appearing in its `overlaps`. Ships `tests/test_capabilities_validator.sh` (each drift class fails
  under `--strict`; the live repo is clean). Not an integrity detector — a repo validator, so the
  detector count is unchanged.
- **manage-refs designated canonical** (issue #16) — `skills/manage-refs/SKILL.md` now carries a
  canonical-source banner for the reference *workflow* (`verify-refs` remains canonical for bib
  *audit*), so external/user-scope notes point here rather than restating the "how" and drifting.

### Documentation

- **Demo 4 — PneumoniaMNIST CNN** (`demo/04_pneumoniamnist_cnn/`). A fourth live demo that runs the
  medical-AI **model-engineering lane** end to end on a public benchmark (PneumoniaMNIST, MedMNIST v2,
  CC BY 4.0) — the deep-learning counterpart to Demos 1–3 (classical stats / manuscript pipeline).
  Architecture choice → scaffold → data-stage/split/hygiene gates → 3-seed training → held-out evaluation
  (AUROC 0.964 ± 0.004; ensemble 0.969, 95% CI 0.956–0.980) → calibration (ECE 0.127) → Grad-CAM with
  Adebayo sanity checks → write-up. Every number is produced by an executed run (results manifest is the
  single source of truth); gate outputs (split-leakage, training-hygiene, explainability-report) are all
  clean; references were verified with `/verify-refs`. Tooling demonstration, not a clinical claim. README
  "Live Demos" now lists four pipelines.

## [5.17.0] - 2026-07-04

Model-engineering produce-side depth — completion. Deployment safety plus the final wiring and candidate
items of the [produce-side depth roadmap](docs/roadmap_model_engineering_depth.md): a new
`uncertainty-imaging` skill + `check_uncertainty_reporting` gate (uncertainty quantification / OOD /
selective prediction for a deployment-framed model), an MLOps wiring reference for `model-scaffold`, and
an `architecture-zoo` graph-neural-net family card (brain connectomes) that closes the last candidate
gap. The six-item roadmap **and** its candidate list are now complete. Additive and backward-compatible;
skills **54 → 55**, integrity detectors **49 → 50**. PRs #279–#281.

### Documentation

- **`architecture-zoo` graph-neural-net family card** (`references/graph.md`) — closes the last candidate
  gap in the [model-engineering coverage map](docs/method_coverage_map.md). Covers GNNs for brain
  **connectomes** and **population graphs** — GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT, GIN, and the brain-specific
  **BrainGNN** — each with its source paper, when-to-use, medical use, PyTorch Geometric / DGL reference
  implementation, and validation setup, plus the connectome-specific traps (subject-level split, ComBat
  site-harmonisation leakage, p ≫ n, interpretability-is-not-proof). States the boundary honestly:
  `model-scaffold` has no graph template, so integrate PyTorch Geometric / DGL directly while the lane's
  subject-level gates (`model-validation`, `radiomics-ml`, `explainability`, `uncertainty-imaging`,
  `check-reporting`) still apply. Reference-only — no skill, no detector, no count change. PR #281.
- **MLOps wiring reference** (`model-scaffold/references/mlops_guide.md`, Item 6 — the final item of the
  [model-engineering produce-side depth roadmap](docs/roadmap_model_engineering_depth.md)). A
  reproducibility-safe **wiring + reporting** reference — experiment tracking (W&B / MLflow /
  TensorBoard), config / data / environment versioning, pipeline orchestration via the framework's own
  (nnU-Net / MONAI bundles), CI-for-ML (gate the network-free properties, never a real training run),
  and an MLOps reporting checklist for TRIPOD+AI / CLAIM. Deliberately **not** a training-loop,
  hyperparameter-search, or experiment-tracking reimplementation — it points to the frameworks and never
  replaces them (the ROADMAP out-of-scope clause). Cross-linked from `model-scaffold` Phase 5 and
  `training_guide.md`. No skill, no detector, no count change. PR #280.

### Added

- **`uncertainty-imaging` skill + `check_uncertainty_reporting` detector** (Item 5 of the
  [model-engineering produce-side depth roadmap](docs/roadmap_model_engineering_depth.md), deployment
  safety). Designs and audits the uncertainty-quantification / out-of-distribution / selective-prediction
  layer of a deployment-framed medical-imaging model, so a clinical-use claim carries calibrated per-case
  uncertainty (MC-dropout / deep ensemble / conformal / Bayesian), an OOD guard validated on a held-out
  OOD set, an abstention rule at a pre-specified operating point, and calibration checked under
  distribution shift. Emits an uncertainty manifest and a stdlib-only deterministic gate with seven
  verdicts: `POINT_PREDICTION_NO_UNCERTAINTY`, `CONFORMAL_NO_COVERAGE_VALIDATION`, `OOD_NO_HELDOUT_SET`
  (Major); `ENSEMBLE_NOT_INDEPENDENT`, `MCDROPOUT_DISABLED_AT_INFERENCE`, `SELECTIVE_NO_TARGET`,
  `NO_CALIBRATION_UNDER_SHIFT` (Minor). Complements `model-evaluation`'s executed calibration/subgroup
  metrics at the reporting-spec level. Ships a `references/uncertainty_guide.md` (conformal coverage
  validation, ensemble independence, MC-dropout-active-at-inference, OOD held-out evaluation, selective
  prediction, calibration-under-shift, TRIPOD+AI / DECIDE-AI reporting), a network-free challenge card,
  and a CI-wired regression test. Integrates MAPIE / captum / OOD scorers by reference; never reimplements
  them or touches real patient data. Skills **54 → 55**, integrity detectors **49 → 50**
  (`reporting_compliance` family). PR #279.

## [5.16.0] - 2026-07-04

Model-engineering produce-side depth, clinical fine-tuning focus — Items 3–4 of the
[produce-side depth roadmap](docs/roadmap_model_engineering_depth.md). A new `radiomics-ml` skill +
`check_radiomics_ml` detector for the most common solo-doable clinical-ML workflow (radiomics /
tabular features → any classical learner → a clinical outcome, no GPU), broadened to the full
classical/statistical-ML family with a learner-agnostic gate; and a `model-scaffold` fine-tuning
mode (`--task finetune` + `--from-pretrained`) that adapts a pretrained backbone on collected clinical
data with a frozen→unfrozen schedule, discriminative learning rates, and a pretrained-weight provenance
record (a `PRETRAINED_PROVENANCE_MISSING` verdict added to the existing `check_training_hygiene` — no
new detector). Plus a ML/DL method coverage map. Additive and backward-compatible; skills **53 → 54**,
integrity detectors **48 → 49**. PRs #276–#278.

### Changed

- **`radiomics-ml` broadened to the full classical / statistical-ML family** (not just RF / XGBoost).
  The skill description, triggers, workflow, and `references/radiomics_ml_guide.md` now enumerate
  penalised regression (LASSO / ridge / elastic-net), SVM, k-NN, naive Bayes, LDA/QDA, trees, bagging,
  boosting (XGBoost / LightGBM / CatBoost / HistGBM / AdaBoost), shallow MLP, stacked ensembles, plus
  unsupervised reduction/clustering — and make explicit that the `check_radiomics_ml` gate is
  **learner-agnostic** (it audits the pipeline, not the algorithm). No code or count change.

### Documentation

- **ML / DL method coverage map** (`docs/method_coverage_map.md`, linked from README and `ROADMAP.md`).
  A single matrix showing every common ML/DL method family — imaging deep learning (CNN / transformer /
  segmentation / detection / foundation-SAM / diffusion / SSL / multimodal), the full classical/tabular
  family, and LLM/MLLM — mapped to the skills that select, produce, validate, interpret, and report it,
  with the integrate-not-reimplement boundary and open candidate gaps (graph neural nets, Item 4
  fine-tuning) stated explicitly.

### Added

- **`model-scaffold` fine-tuning mode** (Item 4 of the
  [model-engineering produce-side depth roadmap](docs/roadmap_model_engineering_depth.md), clinical
  fine-tuning focus). Extends the scaffold from train-from-scratch to the target user's real workflow —
  **fine-tune a pretrained backbone on collected clinical data**. New `--task finetune` +
  `--from-pretrained <source>` emits a leakage-safe transfer-learning repo with a frozen→unfrozen
  schedule, discriminative learning rates, and a pretrained-weight **provenance record**
  (`PRETRAINED.md` + a `config.yaml` `pretrained:` block). The existing `check_training_hygiene` gate
  gains one additive verdict — `PRETRAINED_PROVENANCE_MISSING` (Minor) — that fires when a repo loads
  pretrained weights (`pretrained=True` / `from_pretrained`) but records no provenance; the scaffold
  passes by construction, a hand-rolled fine-tune with no recorded checkpoint fails. Ships a new
  `references/finetuning_guide.md` (freeze schedule, MedSAM/SAM adapter fine-tuning, train-only
  diffusion augmentation with the pretraining-set-contamination leakage warning), plus challenge +
  regression-test coverage for the finetune task and the provenance verdict. Reuses
  `check_training_hygiene` + `check_preprocessing_leakage` — **no new skill, no new detector**
  (skills stay **54**, integrity detectors stay **49**). PR #278.
- **`radiomics-ml` skill + `check_radiomics_ml` detector** (Item 3 of the
  [model-engineering produce-side depth roadmap](docs/roadmap_model_engineering_depth.md), clinical
  fine-tuning focus). Produces and audits a radiomics / tabular clinical-ML study — features → random
  forest / XGBoost / regularised logistic → a clinical outcome, the most common solo-doable clinical-ML
  workflow (no GPU, no engineer). Emits a pipeline manifest and a stdlib-only deterministic gate with
  six verdicts: `NO_NESTED_CV`, `HIGH_DIM_LOW_EVENTS`, `SELECTION_OUTSIDE_CV` (Major);
  `NO_FEATURE_STABILITY`, `NO_CALIBRATION`, `NO_EXTERNAL_VALIDATION` (Minor). Complements the prose
  `check_cv_leakage` audit at the pipeline-spec level. Ships a `references/radiomics_ml_guide.md`
  (pyradiomics/IBSI settings, nested-CV skeleton, ICC stability, calibration + decision curve,
  CLEAR/TRIPOD+AI/PROBAST-AI reporting), a network-free challenge card, and a CI-wired regression test.
  Integrates scikit-learn / xgboost / pyradiomics by reference; never reimplements them or touches real
  patient data. Skills **53 → 54**, integrity detectors **48 → 49** (`data_preparation` family). PR #276.

## [5.15.0] - 2026-07-03

Model-engineering produce-side depth. Two new skills that *produce* the leakage-safe, rigorously
reported artifacts the review lane previously only audited — `preprocess-imaging` (data-stage
leakage) and `explainability` (interpretability rigor) — Items 1–2 of the
[produce-side depth roadmap](docs/roadmap_model_engineering_depth.md), plus a multi-host README/About
refresh, copy-paste citation ergonomics, a release-cadence policy, and a real-project precision fix.
Skills **51 → 53**, integrity detectors **46 → 48**. PRs #271–#275.

### Added

- **`explainability` skill + `check_explainability_report` detector** (Item 2 of the
  [model-engineering produce-side depth roadmap](docs/roadmap_model_engineering_depth.md)). Produces and
  audits the interpretability analysis of a medical-imaging model (Grad-CAM / attention-rollout /
  saliency / integrated-gradients) so it clears the rigor bar reviewers expect: it *produces* what
  `self-review` previously only audited. Emits an explainability-report manifest and a stdlib-only
  deterministic gate with six verdicts: `SALIENCY_AS_VALIDATION`, `NO_SANITY_CHECK`,
  `NO_LOCALIZATION_METRIC` (Major); `INSUFFICIENT_SANITY`, `CHERRY_PICKED_EXAMPLES`, `MISSING_METHOD`
  (Minor). Enforces Adebayo (2018) model- and data-randomisation sanity checks, a quantitative
  localisation metric (IoU / pointing game / Dice vs ground truth) over a cohort, and attribution-not-
  validation framing. Ships a modality-aware `references/explainability_guide.md`, a network-free
  challenge card, and a CI-wired regression test. Integrates captum / pytorch-grad-cam by reference;
  never reimplements them or touches real patient data. Skills **52 → 53**, integrity detectors
  **47 → 48** (`reporting_compliance` family; the family's `MEDSCI_AUDIT.md` row also regained the
  previously-dropped `check_figure_citation`). PR #275.

- **`preprocess-imaging` skill + `check_preprocessing_leakage` detector** (Item 1 of the
  [model-engineering produce-side depth roadmap](docs/roadmap_model_engineering_depth.md)). Designs and
  audits the data-preparation stage of a medical-imaging model *before* `model-scaffold` builds the
  training repo, extending the split-leakage moat upstream to preprocessing. Emits a declarative
  preprocessing manifest (transforms with `type`/`fit_scope`/`stage` + patient-level split) and a
  stdlib-only deterministic gate with six verdicts: `NORMALIZATION_LEAKAGE`, `PREPROCESS_BEFORE_SPLIT`,
  `PATIENT_CROSS_SPLIT` (Major); `AUGMENTATION_ON_EVAL`, `UNSPECIFIED_FIT_SCOPE`, `MISSING_SEED`
  (Minor). A per-sample transform is correctly treated as leakage-free even before the split. Ships a
  modality-aware `references/preprocessing_guide.md`, a network-free challenge card, and a CI-wired
  regression test. Integrates MONAI / TorchIO by reference; never reimplements them or touches real
  patient data. Skills **51 → 52**, integrity detectors **46 → 47** (`data_preparation` family). PR #274.

### Fixed

- **`self-review` scope-coherence: enumerated-defect-label false positive.** `check_scope_coherence`
  no longer fires `CROSS_SECTIONAL_PROGNOSTIC` on a sentence that *names* the anti-pattern as a defect
  in a list (e.g. "… flags … an unsupported prognostic claim in a cross-sectional study, a fabricated
  citation, …"), which the existing meta-document guard missed. A new `ANTIPATTERN_LABEL` guard treats
  a prognostic/surveillance token preceded by a defect adjective (unsupported/unwarranted/…) or
  followed by overclaim/overreach/fallacy/error as a label, not a claim — high-precision, no genuine
  overclaim suppressed. Field-harvested from real-project precision tracking; regression test added.
  No detector count change (46).

### Documentation

- **Model-engineering produce-side depth roadmap** (`docs/roadmap_model_engineering_depth.md`,
  linked from `ROADMAP.md` § Research throughput). Sequences the three thin produce stages of the
  in-scope model-engineering lane — imaging data pipeline + data-stage leakage, interpretability/
  explainability production, uncertainty/OOD reporting — each as a rigor gate with a challenge card,
  never a training-framework reimplementation, released as one batch. Working checklist for the
  next expansion cycle.

- **README: by-stage skill index, multi-host framing, and star history.** A scannable "by research
  stage" grouping of all 51 skills sits above the full table; a Star History chart is added; and the
  About section now states the toolkit runs on all four verified Agent Skills hosts (Claude Code,
  Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot) rather than Claude Code alone. The GitHub repo description and topics
  were broadened to match (leads with "Agent Skills"; adds `codex`/`cursor` topics).

- **Copy-paste citation ergonomics** (README § Citation). Adds a ready-to-adapt Methods/Acknowledgement
  sentence (with a version placeholder), BibTeX for the software (Zenodo) and the design preprint,
  a note that the concept DOI resolves to the latest release, and a pointer to the "Used in research"
  issue → `docs/citations.md`. Lowers the friction to legitimately cite the toolkit.

- **Release-cadence policy** (`docs/maintainer_workflow.md` § Release cadence). Codifies that
  `[Unreleased]` is a staging area a release drains, that a minor release must be a coherent
  user-noticeable batch (not internal symmetry-completion), and a guardrail of at most ~one minor
  release per week under additive work — bundle otherwise; only a broken-install/CI/correctness/security
  patch ships immediately. Content creation (merge when ready, demand-driven) and releasing
  (batch-driven) are decoupled. ROADMAP "honest versioning" now links it; the release checklist
  clarifies draining `[Unreleased]` in place.

## [5.14.0] - 2026-07-02

Research enablement: a fourth executable-depth produce-guide and completion of the worked-exemplar
set. The `analyze-stats` **calibration** guide (probe S7 — the apparent-slope-of-1.00 tell →
bootstrap optimism correction) extends the produce-guide line to agreement / diagnostic-accuracy /
survival / calibration; the `write-paper` **RCT/CONSORT** exemplar completes the five-pillar
reporting-guideline worked-exemplar set (STROBE / STARD / TRIPOD+AI·CLAIM / PRISMA / CONSORT),
raising worked exemplars to 5/10 paper types. No detectors added; **46 integrity detectors
unchanged**. PRs #267–#268.

### Added

- **`write-paper` RCT worked IMRAD structure exemplars (CONSORT 2010).** A fifth study-type structure model (`exemplar_{methods,results,discussion}/rct_consort.md`) completes the five-pillar reporting-guideline set of worked exemplars — STROBE (observational), STARD (diagnostic), TRIPOD+AI/CLAIM (AI validation), PRISMA (systematic review), and now **CONSORT (randomized trial)**. Paragraph-order skeletons anchored to CONSORT 2010 critical items (registration, sequence generation + allocation concealment + blinding as three distinct items, the single pre-specified primary, ITT, a reconciling flow diagram), naming the RCT-specific traps (allocation-concealment-vs-blinding conflation, ITT-vs-per-protocol primary, baseline p-values, clinical-vs-statistical significance vs the MCID); cross-linked to the `rct_trial` domain-probes. Raises worked exemplars 4/10 → 5/10 paper types. SKILL.md Phase 3/Results/Discussion pointers + three exemplar READMEs updated. No detectors, no count change.

- **`analyze-stats` prediction-model calibration methodology guide (`analysis_guides/calibration.md`).** Executable-depth enablement paired with probe **S7** (calibration beyond discrimination): the **apparent calibration slope of a maximum-likelihood fit is exactly 1.00 by construction** (the in-sample tell), so the guide produces the **bootstrap optimism-corrected** slope/intercept (Harrell/Steyerberg) instead; Van Calster's calibration hierarchy (report weak calibration — intercept + slope — plus a flexible curve, not decile bins); scaled Brier; and why **Hosmer–Lemeshow is deprecated** (dropped from the logistic required-outputs in favour of slope/intercept + flexible plot). Survival-at-a-horizon calibration noted. Core claims verified (apparent slope 1.00 → optimism-corrected 0.75 on an overfit model; scaled Brier; calibration-in-the-large). `survival_prognostic` probe S7 gains a "Produce the fix" back-link; SKILL.md loads the guide before generating prediction-model code. No detectors, no count change.

## [5.13.0] - 2026-07-02

Executable-depth research enablement. Two `analyze-stats` produce-guides complete the
core-analysis arc — **agreement → diagnostic-accuracy → survival** — so each of the three
most common analysis families now *produces* the estimand its review domain-probe flags the
absence of (not only checks for it). No detectors added; **46 integrity detectors unchanged**.
PRs #265–#266.

### Added

- **`analyze-stats` survival / time-to-event methodology guide (`analysis_guides/survival.md`).** Executable-depth enablement paired with the `survival_prognostic` domain-probes: **competing risks first** — a naive 1−KM overestimates cumulative incidence, so the guide produces the Aalen–Johansen / Fine–Gray CIF and names cause-specific (etiologic) vs subdistribution (absolute-risk) for the right question (produce-side of probes **S3/S8**); the PH check → **RMST** fallback under non-proportional hazards; reverse-KM median follow-up + C-index-variant selection (**S6**). Core numerical claims (1−KM overestimation vs CIF, reverse-KM, RMST-as-area) verified. `survival_prognostic` probe S3 gains a "Produce the fix" back-link; SKILL.md loads the guide before generating survival code. Completes the executable-depth arc (agreement → diagnostic-accuracy → survival). No detectors, no count change.

- **`analyze-stats` diagnostic-accuracy / reader-study methodology guide (`analysis_guides/diagnostic_accuracy.md`).** Executable-depth enablement paired with the `diagnostic_accuracy` domain-probes: every metric with a CI on a stated per-patient/per-lesion unit (Wilson for proportions, DeLong/bootstrap for AUC); the **confidence-weighted trap** — a strictly-monotone (call × confidence) encoding check that catches the folded-score bug plus the **unweighted-baseline AUC** beside the weighted primary (produce-side of probe **D9**); paired DeLong vs MRMC for reader-generalising claims; a **per-stratum admissibility table** that tests each stratum against a stated AUC rule (produce-side of **D10**); and one-scale-per-comparison (**D11**). All code snippets verified runnable. `diagnostic_accuracy` probe D9 gains a "Produce the fix" back-link; analyze-stats SKILL.md loads the guide before generating diagnostic-accuracy code. No detectors, no count change.

## [5.12.0] - 2026-07-02

Research-enablement continuation plus a feature-selection leakage detector. **Integrity
detectors 45 → 46** (`check_cv_leakage`). Two produce-side artifacts on the research-throughput
frontier — `write-paper` meta-analysis worked IMRAD exemplars (worked structures 3/10 → 4/10
paper types) and an `analyze-stats` agreement/reliability guide paired with self-review probe
O18 — plus a code-label estimand reconcile and a peer-review salvage-reframe sub-rule.
PRs #261–#264.

### Added

- **`write-paper` meta-analysis worked IMRAD structure exemplars (PRISMA 2020).** A fourth
  study-type structure model completes the trio in `exemplar_methods/`, `exemplar_results/`,
  and `exemplar_discussion/` (`meta_analysis_prisma.md`) — paragraph-order skeletons stating
  what each Methods/Results/Discussion paragraph must establish for a systematic review with
  quantitative synthesis, anchored to PRISMA 2020 critical items (verbatim search strategy,
  reconciling flow diagram, per-study risk of bias, protocol/registration) and cross-linked to
  the `sr_ma` domain-probes. Enablement (produce, not check): raises worked exemplars from 3/10
  to 4/10 paper types. SKILL.md Phase 3/Results/Discussion pointers and the three exemplar
  READMEs updated; `paper_types/meta_analysis.md` now points to the skeletons. No detectors,
  no count change.

- **`analyze-stats` inter-rater agreement/reliability methodology guide (`analysis_guides/agreement_reliability.md`).** Executable-depth enablement paired with self-review probe O18: the pseudoreplication trap for clustered/repeated measurements + the pseudoreplication-safe per-subject-aggregation and subject-random-effect ICC code (produce, not only flag), ICC model/type selection, and the agreement-vs-reliability distinction. Wired into the skill's agreement section and cross-linked from O18.

- **`check_claim_artifact` gains `--scripts` + `PRIMARY_LABEL_CODE_DRIFT` (advisory; no count change).** When the manuscript asserts a SINGLE primary model/analysis but an analysis script annotates a model as `co-primary`, the code label (a third SSOT) has drifted — reconcile it with the declared estimand. Advisory, since code comments can lag.

- **`check_cv_leakage` (self-review, `data_preparation`; integrity detectors 45 → 46).** `CV_SELECTION_LEAKAGE` (Major): for a classifier / NLP / tabular manuscript, a data-driven selection step (feature selection, log-odds / univariate filtering, vocabulary construction, a threshold) that co-occurs with cross-validation without any fold-nesting disclosure ('within each fold', 'nested CV') — if the selection was fit on the full dataset the CV metric is optimistically inflated. Distinct from patient-vs-image split leakage.
- **peer-review §1C contribution-gate: salvage-reframe sub-rule.** A fix that *narrows* a claim to survive a construct/validity flaw is Reject-leaning, not an encourage-major-revision, when novelty/importance is already weak — a shrunk contribution is the product, not addressable-in-revision.

## [5.11.0] - 2026-07-02

Review-harvest inbox goal-mode processing: field-observed self-review / peer-review
gaps promoted into detectors, domain-probes, and precision fixes. **Integrity
detectors 42 → 45** (`check_rounded_delta`, `check_figure_citation`,
`check_emphasis_density`); seven review domain-probes added (sr_ma P18/P19,
observational O18, diagnostic_accuracy D9/D10/D11, ai_overclaiming AO7); one new
supplement-hygiene verdict; five precision fixes on already-shipped detectors.

### Added

- **`check_supplement_hygiene` gains `SUPP_PARTICIPANT_PII_TIE` (Major; no count change).** Flags a reader/participant identity — a pseudonym (`R`+hex) or a named participant — tied to an INDIVIDUAL response on one line of a reader-facing / public supplement (a re-identifiable datum). A byline / roster line with only aggregate responses does not fire. Motivated by a preprint supplement that linked a reader pseudonym to a real name + individual response.

- **Four review domain-probes (no detector-count change).** Canonical in `peer-review`, vendored into `self-review`: **diagnostic_accuracy D9** (confidence-weighted reader study needs an unweighted-baseline AUC + monotonic-encoding check), **D10** (a "no stratum met threshold X" claim vs a per-stratum AUC+CI table that does meet X), **D11** (mixed-normalisation values in one comparison column), and **ai_overclaiming AO7** (a "within/comparable-to X variability" claim whose benchmark X was never quantified). SKILL.md probe ranges updated (D1–D11, AO0–AO7).

- **Three review domain-probes (no detector-count change).** Canonical in `peer-review`, vendored byte-identical into `self-review`: **sr_ma P18** (train-vs-validation pool integrity — an apparent/in-sample estimate smuggled into the "validation" pool), **sr_ma P19** (reviewer-side included-study cell audit — metric-type identity, self-eligibility contradiction, CI provenance), and **observational_confounding O18** (pseudoreplication in multi-rater agreement / reader studies — pooled pairwise vs per-subject). SKILL.md probe ranges/counts updated.

- **`check_emphasis_density`** (self-review `style_review`, humanize Pattern 25; integrity detectors 44 → 45) — `EMPHASIS_OVERUSE` (Minor): inline italic-emphasis density over a per-1000-word threshold (after an allowlist of statistical symbols, Latin phrases, and gene/species terms) is an LLM typographic tell. Bold is NOT counted so a Nature/npj bold run-in subheading is never flagged; whole-clause italics escalate. humanize gains Pattern 25 pointing at it.
- **Two self-review deterministic detectors (integrity detectors 42 → 44).** Each
  ships positive+negative fixtures, a regression test wired into `validate.yml` +
  `skill.yml`, and a family mapping.
  - **`check_rounded_delta`** (`numerical_cohort`, Phase 2.5a) — `ROUNDED_DELTA_MISMATCH`
    (Minor): a stated difference must equal the subtraction of its two displayed
    component values at the same precision. Catches "AUC 0.70 vs 0.73 … difference 0.02"
    (a shown gap of 0.03). A higher-precision component pair with a lower-precision delta
    is the legitimate unrounded case and is not flagged.
  - **`check_figure_citation`** (`reporting_compliance`, Phase 2.5d) — `FIGURE_ORPHAN` /
    `TABLE_ORPHAN` (Minor): every captioned `Figure N.` / `Table N.` must be cited at
    least once in the body. The markdown-stage, no-build counterpart to `check_xref`'s
    DOCX-stage `UNCITED`.

### Fixed

- **Four self-review detector precision fixes (no count change, no schema change).**
  Field-observed false positives / masking on already-shipped gates, each with a
  positive+negative regression fixture:
  - `check_binning_consistency` (`DERIVED_DEF_DRIFT`) no longer fires on a legitimately
    **parallel sensitivity cohort** — the SAME derivation rule expressed against a
    different dataframe-receiver object (`v0['col']` vs `lenient_cohort['col']`). The
    clause-set now compares on column+operator+rhs; the Python `df['col']` subscript is
    dropped from each atom, matching the existing base-R `df$col` normalisation.
  - `check_null_calibration` (`CONFIRM_NULL_NO_MDE`) is now **per-claim-site**: a
    power/CI caveat co-located with one null no longer masks a bare "equivalence within
    the bound" claim in a different region. Each unqualified claim site is evaluated on
    its own neighbourhood.
  - `check_scope_coherence` (`CROSS_SECTIONAL_PROGNOSTIC`) no longer fires on a
    **meta-document** — a QC/methods/detector paper (or review) whose SUBJECT is the
    anti-pattern and that NAMES it rather than committing it.
  - `check_classical_style` (`INBODY_AI_DISCLOSURE`) no longer fires on a paper whose
    SUBJECT is AI-use disclosure and that carries disclosure phrasing as an object of
    study. All meta-document guards are kept tight (they require the meta-framing
    structure) so a genuine overclaim / in-body disclosure is never suppressed.
  - `check_claim_artifact` (`ESTIMAND_DRIFT`) now anchors on explicit structured
    prereg fields (`primary_exposure` / `primary_outcome` / `primary_estimand` / …)
    when the pre-registration is a `project.yaml` / form, rather than on a free-text
    paragraph or a `# PRIMARY — locked` YAML comment. Structured extraction reads the
    raw (line-based) prereg; a moderate overlap against a structured field is a soft
    `ESTIMAND_CONFIRM` (advisory) instead of a false `ESTIMAND_DRIFT`. Removes the
    false drift flag on an estimand already reconciled to the registration.

## [5.10.0] - 2026-07-01

Figures enablement — the make-figures **render-test layer** grows from 4 to **10** tested,
deterministic generators, substantively closing the suite's self-identified weakest area.
No count change (the render layer is a generator, not a detector).

### Added

- **make-figures render layer extended to MRMC ROC, Manhattan, and clinical timeline.**
  Three more deterministic generators in `scripts/render_core_figures.py`, each with
  `assert_structure` invariants: **MRMC ROC** (a curve per reader + the reader-averaged
  curve + chance diagonal + averaged-AUC annotation — reader studies), **Manhattan**
  (point scatter + named significance-threshold line + −log10(p) axis — agnostic
  many-exposure scans), and **clinical timeline** (time baseline + an event marker/label at
  each event + time axis — case reports). The render-regression challenge now renders all
  **ten** figures. `imaging_panel` is documented as staying prose-only by design (it
  composes real images, not computed numbers). Detector count unchanged. Only `imaging_panel`
  now remains a prose-only exemplar.

- **make-figures render layer extended to forest, Bland–Altman, and confusion matrix.**
  Building on the v5.9.0 tested-generator layer (KM / ROC / calibration / decision-curve),
  `scripts/render_core_figures.py` gains three more deterministic generators from
  already-computed inputs, each with `assert_structure` load-bearing-element invariants:
  **forest** (per-study CI whisker for every study + null reference line + pooled diamond +
  study/pooled row labels), **Bland–Altman** (difference scatter + bias line + 95% limits of
  agreement at bias ± 1.96·SD + difference-vs-mean axes), and **confusion matrix** (matrix
  image + every cell annotated + Predicted/Actual axes). The render-regression challenge now
  renders all **seven** figures from the synthetic fixture and confirms the gate fails on a
  non-monotonic KM curve *and* a non-square confusion matrix. Detector count unchanged
  (render layer is a generator, not a `check_*` detector). Continues closing the suite's
  self-identified weakest area; forest / Bland–Altman / confusion move from prose-only
  exemplars to tested generators.

## [5.9.2] - 2026-07-01

Maintenance patch (no count change).

### Fixed

- **`gen_distribution_manifest.py` no longer scans `installers/.logs/`.** The gitignored,
  per-machine install logs `install.py` writes there were picked up by the manifest scan,
  so running `install.py` locally and regenerating would add a machine-specific log path
  to the inventory (local `--check` drift, or an accidental committed log path). `.logs` is
  added to the generator's excluded directory names; a regression assertion in
  `installers/tests/test_distribution_manifest.py` (CI-wired) locks it — a stray
  `installers/.logs/*.txt` is excluded and a normal installer file is still included.

## [5.9.1] - 2026-07-01

Documentation + connector-transparency patch (no count change; behaviour unchanged by
default). Adds a research-connector registry and clarifies that the toolkit's external
APIs are keyless public services, plus an adjacent-not-competing note vs hosted
AI-for-science workbenches.

### Added

- **Research-connector registry (`docs/connectors.md`).** A declarative registry of the
  external research APIs the skills call — PubMed / NCBI E-utilities, CrossRef, OpenAlex
  (verification) and Unpaywall / Europe PMC / PMC (open-access full text) — with what uses
  each, its keyless/legitimate boundary, and a plain "how you authorize" guide. The
  clinical-manuscript analogue of a curated connector panel: **keyless public APIs (nothing
  to paste in the common case)**, a `.claude/settings.json` permission-allowlist snippet as
  the "call these domains without asking each time" mechanism, and an explicit boundary
  (metadata + open access only; no paywalled-publisher scraping, no institution-auth
  connectors, no omics/cheminformatics databases). Linked from the README intro.

### Changed

- **Optional contact-email / NCBI key via environment (never required).**
  `fetch_oa.py --email` now falls back to `MEDSCI_CONTACT_EMAIL` (and errors clearly if a
  contact email is set nowhere — Unpaywall requires one). `verify_refs.py` E-utilities
  calls now send NCBI-recommended `tool`/`email` courtesy params and honour an optional
  `NCBI_API_KEY` (raising the PubMed rate limit from 3 → 10 req/s); absent the key the calls
  stay keyless, so behaviour is unchanged by default. All verify-refs + fulltext-retrieval
  tests pass.

- **Competitive positioning — adjacent-not-competing note for hosted AI-for-science
  workbenches (Claude Science).** `docs/competitive_positioning.md` gains an "Adjacent
  platforms" section clarifying that a hosted bench/omics workbench (Anthropic's Claude
  Science: genomics / single-cell / proteomics / structural biology / cheminformatics,
  biological-database connectors, compute/HPC, BioNeMo) is **complementary**, not
  competing: different scientific domain (clinical manuscript / observational epidemiology
  vs bench/omics), different core value (EQUATOR reporting-guideline compliance +
  submission / peer-review + drift control, which such a workbench does not cover), and the
  same Agent Skills primitive — so a clinical-manuscript skill-set sits alongside it, and
  stays open-source (MIT), host-portable, and citable where a hosted product is
  subscription-gated.

## [5.9.0] - 2026-07-01

A **research-enablement pivot**. After six reporting-guideline lanes and exhaustion of the
scored reverse-engineering backlog (G50–G68), this release rebalances the suite toward
*producing* research rather than only checking it: a tested figure-render layer, design-time
artifacts (target-trial emulation + DAG adjustment sets), prediction-model sample sizing, a
prospective/deployment-monitoring model-validation seam, default-on clinical-utility output,
a less-defensive review layer, and a roadmap / gap-scoring correction. Skill, detector, and
reporting-guideline counts are unchanged (51 / 42 / 44).

### Changed

- **Hygiene + self-review SKILL.md slimming.**
  - `installers/install.py` now writes timestamped install logs to a gitignored
    `installers/.logs/` directory and prunes to the most recent 10, instead of accumulating
    them in the repo root (21 had piled up). `.gitignore` updated.
  - `self-review` SKILL.md (1399 lines) starts honouring the maintainer's own
    reference-split rule: the observational-only **Phase 2.5e (Confounding Completeness,
    ~84 lines)** is extracted to `references/phases/confounding_completeness.md` and loaded
    on demand. A non-observational review (RCT, diagnostic-accuracy, SR/MA, descriptive) no
    longer carries the procedure inline. The stub preserves the trigger, the deterministic
    `check_confounding_completeness.py --strict` gate, and the research-type gating; full
    content is byte-preserved in the reference. SKILL.md 1399 → 1344 lines; the same
    pattern can be extended to the other research-type-gated phases.
### Added

- **model-validation — prospective evaluation & deployment-monitoring seam (DECIDE-AI).**
  The validation tier ladder stopped at "multi-site / prospective external" and the lane
  never routed to DECIDE-AI, leaving no design step for the clinical-use horizon a model is
  headed toward. `references/validation_design.md` §2b now extends the ladder past
  retrospective external to **silent / shadow deployment → prospective comparative (impact)
  RCT → live deployment + post-deployment monitoring** (performance / dataset-shift /
  calibration drift with recalibration-or-withdrawal triggers + ongoing subgroup audit). A
  new SKILL **Phase 6.5** covers this horizon and scopes claims to the tier reached, and
  Phase 7 reporting now routes prospective/live evaluation to **DECIDE-AI** (early clinical
  evaluation) or **CONSORT-AI / SPIRIT-AI** in addition to CLAIM 2024 / TRIPOD+AI / STARD-AI.
- **calc-sample-size — Riley prediction-model sample size (Tests 12–13).** For a clinical
  prediction / medical-AI model, EPV-10 (Tests 9/11) is outdated and reviewer-vulnerable.
  New `references/prediction_model_sample_size.md` + decision-tree branch + Tests 12
  (development via `pmsampsize` — the four Riley criteria) and 13 (external validation via
  `pmvalsampsize` — target CI widths for the C-statistic, calibration slope, O:E, and net
  benefit). Test 9's EPV note now scopes EPV-10 to single-predictor hypothesis tests and
  routes prediction models to Riley. (TRIPOD+AI-aligned; directly in the radiology-AI lane.)

### Changed

- **analyze-stats — clinical utility is a default output, not an optional add-on.** The
  primary-effect output contract now *requires*, by default: absolute risk + risk
  difference + NNT/NNH (baseline stated) for OR/HR/RR outcomes; the IQR-anchored
  real-world-translation line for continuous outcomes; and a **decision-curve / net-benefit
  pass** (plus incremental net benefit / NRI / IDI over the established clinical model) for
  prediction / classification models — not AUC alone. Moves the headline from
  "significant / X-fold" toward "changes this decision by this much."
- **design-study — target-trial-emulation module + DAG adjustment-set scaffold
  (design-time enablement frontier).** `design-study` told authors to "emulate a target
  trial" and "pre-specify the adjustment set from a DAG" but shipped **no scaffold** (it
  had no `references/` or `scripts/`). Two design artifacts now make that buildable:
  - `references/target_trial_emulation.md` — the seven-component target-trial protocol
    table (eligibility, treatment strategies, assignment, **time zero**, outcome, causal
    contrast, analysis plan) with its data emulation, plus the immortal-time / prevalent-
    user / confounding-by-indication guards, new-user + active-comparator design, the
    grace-period clone-censor-weight pattern, ITT-vs-per-protocol estimand choice, and
    negative-control falsification. Turns an association into a defensible causal contrast
    — the highest-leverage point for the suite's NHIS/registry/RWE work.
  - `references/dag_adjustment.md` + `scripts/adjustment_set_helper.py` — DAG-based
    confounder selection. The helper deterministically classifies each proposed covariate
    by DAG role (reachability only) and flags `MEDIATOR_ADJUSTMENT`,
    `DESCENDANT_ADJUSTMENT`, `COLLIDER_ADJUSTMENT`, and `CONFOUNDER_OMITTED`, proposing a
    candidate backdoor set; it defers the **minimal** sufficient set to dagitty (a
    validated tool) and never ships a homegrown d-separation solver. A confounder is
    defined soundly as a common cause with an **X-free** path to the outcome, so an
    instrument-like `A→X→Y` ancestor is not mis-flagged. A network-free challenge
    (`scripts/adjustment_set_challenge/`, wired into `skill.yml` validation) locks the
    classification on canonical confounder / mediator / M-bias / instrument DAGs.
  - Detector catalogue count unchanged (the helper is a design-time generator, validated
    by its challenge, not a manuscript-integrity `check_*` detector).
- **make-figures — runnable, tested render layer for the four core clinical figures
  (research-enablement frontier).** The suite's self-identified weakest area had prose
  figure anatomy but **no deterministic render test for any data plot**. New
  `scripts/render_core_figures.py` turns the Kaplan–Meier, ROC, calibration, and
  decision-curve exemplar anatomies into deterministic matplotlib generators that take
  already-computed inputs (the statistical estimation stays in `/analyze-stats`; the
  render layer never recomputes a number) and `assert_structure` introspects the actual
  matplotlib artists to verify each figure's load-bearing elements — KM number-at-risk
  table + monotonic survival + no extrapolation past follow-up; ROC chance diagonal +
  AUC annotation + operating point; calibration identity line + slope/intercept;
  decision-curve treat-all/treat-none references + net-benefit axis. A network-free
  render-regression challenge (`scripts/render_core_figures_challenge/`, wired into
  `skill.yml` validation) renders all four from a synthetic fixture and confirms the
  structural gate fails on a malformed figure (non-monotonic KM). Closes the
  defense/enablement asymmetry (integrity detectors had challenge fixtures; the figure
  generators had none).
### Changed

- **Less-defensive QC trims (precision over volume).** The over-defensiveness in the
  review layer is structural/volume-driven, not per-detector; three trims reduce
  manufactured findings without weakening genuine gates:
  - `self-review` panel template no longer imposes a per-reviewer comment **quota**
    ("Produce 4–8 major / 4–10 minor"). Reviewers now report **only genuine threats** —
    zero majors is a valid outcome for a clean manuscript — while the Step 3.5
    lens-diversity gate still enforces axis *coverage* (so under-reporting is caught).
  - `check_claim_artifact.py`: `ESTIMAND_DRIFT` (fuzzy prereg↔manuscript token overlap)
    is **downgraded from Major to advisory** — the docs already require manual
    confirmation against the registration, and a P0 that needs hand-confirmation is not
    a P0. A bare honest **manuscript-stage analytical-decision disclosure** (which
    estimand-provenance guidance *recommends writing*) is now a separate advisory
    `PRIMARY_DISCLOSURE_NOTE`, not `PRIMARY_REASSIGNED`; only **explicit** post-hoc
    re-designation remains Major. New regression case locks the advisory behaviour.
  - `check_framework_naming.py`: `VAGUE_GUIDANCE` is now **context-gated** to sentences
    with a reporting cue (report/reporting/checklist/EQUATOR), so method-level wording
    like "external validation following recent best-practice recommendations" no longer
    false-fires. New FP-guard regression case added.
- **Direction pivot — research throughput over compliance breadth.** After six
  consecutive reporting-guideline lanes (v5.3.0–v5.8.0) and exhaustion of the
  scored reverse-engineering backlog (G50–G68), the roadmap and gap-scoring model
  are rebalanced toward research-enablement:
  - `ROADMAP.md` near-term priorities are restructured into a **Research
    throughput (frontier)** tier — figure & artifact generation, executable
    analysis depth, design-time enablement — above a demoted **Sustaining
    (reliability floor)** tier. New reporting-guideline lanes are now explicitly
    *maintenance mode*.
  - `reverse_engineer/gap_register.md` scoring gains a **leverage** multiplier
    (`score = impact × frequency × deficit × leverage`; check-only 1.0 / ships an
    artifact 1.5 / unblocks a pre-data-collection decision 2.0) plus a
    **saturation tax** (deficit − 2 for an Nth genre lane that only adds a
    presence-check). Corrects the structural bias toward checkable-over-generative
    gaps. The G50–G68 batch is marked `closed`.
  - `README.md` model-lane wording corrected: `model-scaffold` ships a minimal
    runnable default model for a forward-pass smoke test and *integrates* MONAI /
    nnU-Net / timm / torchvision for production models, rather than the prior
    "never reimplements" claim (the scaffold emits a smoke-test U-Net/CNN).

## [5.8.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- **Qualitative-research reporting lane (SRQR + COREQ + QL1–QL8 domain probes).** A new
  study-genre lane for **qualitative studies** — interviews, focus groups, ethnography,
  grounded theory, phenomenology, document analysis:
  - `check-reporting` gains two checklists — **SRQR** (`references/checklists/SRQR.md`, alias
    `srqr` / `qualitative`; 21 items, all qualitative approaches; O'Brien et al. *Acad Med*
    2014, DOI 10.1097/ACM.0000000000000388) and **COREQ** (`COREQ.md`, alias `coreq`; 32 items
    in 3 domains, interviews/focus groups specifically; Tong et al. *Int J Qual Health Care*
    2007, DOI 10.1093/intqhc/mzm042). Both are **in-house faithful summaries** of the item
    intents (paraphrased — both standards are ©, no Creative Commons licence). Brings the
    reporting-guideline catalogue to **44**.
  - `peer-review` / `self-review` gain a vendored, byte-identical **`qualitative_research.md`**
    domain probe (**QL1–QL8**): approach/paradigm fit, researcher **reflexivity**, purposive
    sampling & saturation (a small sample is not a flaw), data-collection rigour, **analysis
    transparency / audit trail** (not "themes emerged"), **trustworthiness** (credibility/
    dependability/confirmability/transferability — *not* statistical validity), findings
    grounded in quoted data, and ethics/interpretive scope. Includes the **bidirectional
    calibration trap** — neither demand quantitative yardsticks (power, "representative" sample,
    statistical generalizability, κ-as-truth) of qualitative work, nor let it claim causal/
    prevalence/population over-reach. Review domain-probe modules: 21 → **22**.
  - Wired into check-reporting study-type routing and the peer-review / self-review trigger tables.
- Counts: 51 skills / 42 detectors / **44 reporting guidelines** / **22 review domain-probe modules**.

## [5.7.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- **Scoping-review reporting lane (PRISMA-ScR + SC1–SC8 domain probes).** A new study-genre
  lane for **scoping reviews** — reviews that *map* the breadth/nature of evidence, clarify
  concepts, and identify gaps (distinct from a systematic review, which answers a focused
  effectiveness/accuracy question):
  - `check-reporting` gains a **PRISMA-ScR** checklist (`references/checklists/PRISMA_ScR.md`,
    aliases `prisma-scr` / `scoping review` / `scoping`) — an **in-house faithful summary** of
    the 20 essential + 2 optional reporting items (paraphrased intents, not verbatim; the
    PRISMA-ScR statement is ©ACP with no Creative Commons licence), citing Tricco et al.
    *Ann Intern Med* 2018 (DOI 10.7326/M18-0850). Brings the reporting-guideline catalogue to **42**.
  - `peer-review` / `self-review` gain a vendored, byte-identical **`scoping_review.md`** domain
    probe (**SC1–SC8**): scoping fit & PCC framing, a-priori protocol (OSF, not PROSPERO),
    eligibility by concept, search comprehensiveness, selection & data **charting**, the
    **asymmetric critical-appraisal calibration** (a scoping review need not assess risk of bias —
    do not flag its absence, but do flag GRADE-style certainty claimed without appraisal),
    **synthesis-is-mapping-not-pooling** (no pooled effect/accuracy estimate from a scoping
    review), and interpretation/gaps/terminology. Review domain-probe modules: 20 → **21**.
  - Wired into the `make-figures` figure map (PRISMA-ScR flow diagram), check-reporting study-type
    routing, and the peer-review / self-review trigger tables.
- Counts: 51 skills / 42 detectors / **42 reporting guidelines** / **21 review domain-probe modules**.

## [5.6.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- **`/self-review` editorial-impression counterweight (the "ceiling" pass).** The gate stack
  minimizes *rejection-for-cause* (the floor) and several gates do so by *adding* hedges,
  caveats, disclosures, and audit trails — with no opposing force, iterated self-review
  monotonically over-defends until an editor reads the manuscript as a rebuttal letter. New
  deterministic detector `check_editorial_impression.py` (self-review category **L** /
  Phase 2.5g) reads the manuscript as a whole and recommends **SUBTRACTION** — REMOVE / MOVE /
  TIGHTEN:
  - `HEDGE_DENSITY` (defensive-caveat tokens per 1,000 narrative words), `HEDGE_REPEAT` (one
    caveat motif repeated across body + Abstract), `AUDIT_IN_BODY` (SHA / commit / unit-test /
    post-lock / manifest / seed in the Intro/Results/Discussion narrative → Methods/supplement),
    `LIMITATIONS_VOLUME` (a long enumerated Limitations list), `ABSTRACT_CAVEAT_LOAD` (caveat
    clauses crowding the Abstract), and `BURIED_DEFENSE` (a strong numeric robustness/sensitivity
    result hidden in Limitations/supplement → promote to Results — the inverse of the
    scope-coherence gate).
  - **Advisory and non-blocking** — every finding is Minor with a REMOVE/MOVE/TIGHTEN `action`;
    the gate emits no Major and exits 0 even under `--strict`. Thresholds are tunable. Conservative
    by construction (fires only on an explicit, locatable signal); ships positive + negative
    challenge-card fixtures and a CI-wired regression test.
  - SKILL.md gains a **two-objective frame** (quality = min rejection-for-cause AND max
    editorial-championing), a first-class **Editorial-Impression Risks (REMOVE/MOVE/TIGHTEN)**
    report block kept separate from the additive Anticipated-Comments axis, and a `--panel`
    **handling-editor desk-impression** persona plus an editor-synthesis defensiveness lens
    symmetric to the contribution lens.
- Counts: 51 skills / **42 detectors** / 41 reporting guidelines / 20 review domain-probe modules.

## [5.5.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- **Survey-research lane (CROSS / CHERRIES).** The third study-genre lane of the autonomous
  reverse-engineer cycle (after CHEERS and RECORD), filling the most common uncovered manuscript type:
  - `check-reporting/references/checklists/CROSS.md` — an in-house faithful summary of the CROSS 2021
    reportable elements (paraphrased item intents; CROSS is ©SGIM, so not reproduced verbatim — DOI
    cited) integrating the CC-BY CHERRIES internet-survey items. Routed via the study-type table +
    `cross` alias. **Reporting guidelines 40 → 41.**
  - `peer-review` + `self-review` `domain-probes/survey_research.md` (SV1–SV8; vendored byte-identical,
    review domain-probe modules 19 → 20): sampling-frame representativeness, sampling method +
    sample-size justification, response rate (defined denominator) + non-response bias, instrument
    development/validation/reliability, CHERRIES e-survey specifics, question design,
    weighting/denominators/missingness, generalisability/ethics.
- Counts: 51 skills / 41 detectors / **41 reporting guidelines** / 20 review domain-probe modules.

## [5.4.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- **RECORD lane — routinely-collected / registry / claims / EHR observational reporting.** The second
  lane of the autonomous reverse-engineer cycle (after CHEERS), chosen by the same CC-BY-cleanliness
  logic and directly relevant to the suite's heavy NHIS/KNHANES/health-checkup-DB cohort emphasis:
  - `check-reporting/references/checklists/RECORD.md` — faithful 13-item RECORD summary (base STROBE +
    RECORD extension; RECORD-PE noted for drug studies; CC BY 4.0, Benchimol et al. *PLoS Med* 2015).
    Routed via the study-type table + `record` alias. **Reporting guidelines 39 → 40.**
  - `peer-review` + `self-review` `domain-probes/record_routinely_collected_data.md` (RD1–RD8; vendored
    byte-identical, review domain-probe modules 18 → 19): database fitness-for-purpose, phenotype
    code-lists & validation, data linkage & linkage-quality, participant-selection flow incl.
    data-quality filtering, misclassification, informative missingness, unmeasured confounding +
    immortal-time/prevalent-user (RECORD-PE), eligibility drift + code/protocol availability.
- Counts: 51 skills / 41 detectors / **40 reporting guidelines** / 19 review domain-probe modules.

## [5.3.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- **Health economic evaluation lane (CHEERS 2022).** A new study-genre lane filling the suite's
  largest open reporting gap (absent from medsci-skills and from competing toolkits), surfaced by an
  EQUATOR-grounded competitor + reporting-standard research scan:
  - `check-reporting/references/checklists/CHEERS_2022.md` — faithful 28-item CHEERS 2022 summary
    (CC BY 4.0, Husereau et al. *BMJ* 2022); routed via the study-type table + `cheers`/`cheers2022`
    aliases. **Reporting guidelines 38 → 39.**
  - `peer-review` + `self-review` `domain-probes/health_economic_evaluation.md` (HE1–HE8; vendored
    byte-identical, review domain-probe modules 17 → 18): comparator/perspective, time-horizon &
    discounting, effectiveness source + QALY valuation, costing/currency/price-year, model structure
    + validation, deterministic and **probabilistic** uncertainty (PSA/CEAC, not a point ICER), ICER
    vs a stated willingness-to-pay threshold + dominance, equity/generalisability/funding-COI.
  - `analyze-stats` `analysis_guides/health_economic_evaluation.md` + SKILL entry — ICER/net-benefit,
    decision-analytic models (Markov/DES), PSA → plane + CEAC, `heemod`/`dampack`/`BCEA`.
- Counts: 51 skills / 41 detectors / **39 reporting guidelines** / 18 review domain-probe modules.

## [5.2.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- **Model-engineering lane — reference grounding for three thin lane skills.** New load-on-demand
  reference docs, grounded in named public standards (cross-checked against the repo's own
  check-reporting SSOT, e.g. STARD-AI *Nat Med* 2025, PROBAST+AI *BMJ* 2025), wired into each
  SKILL.md:
  - `model-validation/references/validation_design.md` — data-leakage taxonomy, internal vs
    genuine-external validation, comparator/variance/test-set sizing, CLAIM 2024 / TRIPOD+AI /
    STARD-AI reporting map.
  - `mllm-eval/references/evaluation_axes.md` — clinical-efficacy metrics beyond n-gram overlap,
    faithfulness/hallucination, benchmark contamination, prompt-sensitivity, answer-matching,
    reader study.
  - `model-evaluation/references/metric_selection_grounding.md` — Metrics Reloaded task-fingerprint
    principle, calibration vs discrimination, disaggregated reporting, CLAIM 2024 reporting fit.

### Fixed

- **`model-evaluation` metric-reporting gate false positive.** `check_metric_reporting.py`'s
  `iou_crit` proximity window used `[^.\n]`, so a hard-wrapped IoU match criterion (the IoU and its
  threshold on different physical lines) was undetectable and the gate fired a spurious
  `DETECTION_METRIC_MISSING` on a legitimately formatted detection report. Changed to `[^.]`
  (newline-tolerant, still period-bounded); locked by a load-bearing `det_good_wrapped` regression
  case plus `det_no_iou` detection-branch coverage in the CI-wired `metric_reporting_challenge`.

- Counts unchanged (**51 skills / 41 detectors / 38 reporting guidelines / 14 probes**); reference
  docs are uncounted.

## [5.1.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- **`/lit-sync` fulltext-retrieval phase (opt-in, owner-only).** A new Phase 2.7 orchestrates two
  complementary full-text routes and reconciles them into `references/fulltext_retrieval.json`:
  disk open-access PDFs by delegating to the `/fulltext-retrieval` engine, and in-library
  Zotero-native PDFs via a user-run `find_available_pdf.js` snippet that triggers Zotero's own
  `addAvailablePDF` / `addAvailablePDFs` — reusing the user's own proxy / OpenURL configuration, so
  no credentials or institutional identifiers ever enter the skill. Adds a DOI/PMID/Title worklist
  entry mode.
- **`fetch_oa.py` (the single authored open-access cascade) enhancements:** TSV/CSV/Markdown-table +
  `Title` worklist parsing; direct **arXiv** resolution for `10.48550/arXiv.*` DOIs (new/old-style,
  version suffixes); a `--report retrieval_report.json` (schema_version + per-DOI
  `status`/`source`/`title_match` tri-state); and pure, offline-testable report/title-match helpers
  with a best-effort `pdftotext` title cross-check that **flags** mislabeled PDFs without
  auto-rejecting them. New network-free `fetch_oa_report_challenge` wired into CI.

### Changed

- **DRY consolidation.** `/search-lit` Phase 5 now delegates full-text retrieval to
  `/fulltext-retrieval` and drops the duplicated inline open-access code (and the unsafe Sci-Hub
  env-var wording) — the OA cascade now lives in exactly one authored place.
- Counts unchanged (**51 skills / 41 detectors / 38 reporting guidelines / 14 probes**).

## [5.0.0] - 2026-06-28

### Changed

- **v5.0.0 — storefront repositioning for the medical-AI model-engineering lane.** A material
  distribution change, not a label bump: the model-engineering lane (built additively across
  v4.x Phases 1–4 plus the Phase 5 breadth below) now has its own storefront home and the repo's
  identity is widened to cover it.
  - **New `model_engineering` storefront category** ("Model Engineering & Validation") and
    **`medsci-modeling` marketplace plugin**, carved out of "Data & Study Design" (`medsci-data`).
    The 6 lane skills — `architecture-zoo`, `model-scaffold`, `model-validation`, `model-card`,
    `model-evaluation`, `mllm-eval` — now group under their own catalog filter and installable
    plugin (`/plugin` now lists nine category plugins). Both catalog generators
    (`gen_skills_catalog_json.py` category mapping/order, `gen_marketplace_json.py` plugin
    name/description) and their self-tests cover the new category.
  - **README + ROADMAP repositioned to the end-to-end identity**: MedSci Skills is an end-to-end
    research tool for physician and medical-engineering researchers to design → scaffold →
    validate → publish — for the clinical manuscript and the medical-AI model alike. "Clinical AI
    model research engineering is in scope" is now explicit, while "not a general AI-scientist
    platform" (and not a diagnostic tool or autonomous author) is kept; the lane **integrates**
    MONAI / nnU-Net and never reimplements them or runs anything autonomously.
  - Counts unchanged (**51 skills / 41 detectors / 38 reporting guidelines**); CI stays torch-free.

### Added

- **Medical-AI model-engineering lane — Phase 5 (build-lane breadth).** Expands the existing
  `/model-scaffold` and `/architecture-zoo` skills; no new skills/detectors/probes (counts
  unchanged: 51 skills / 41 detectors / 38 guidelines), torch-free CI.
  - **`/model-scaffold` now generates 5 task types** (was segmentation-only): `--task`
    **segmentation** (U-Net), **classification** (small multi-label CNN; swap in a `timm`
    backbone), **detection** (torchvision Faster R-CNN + FPN), **synthesis** (Pix2Pix U-Net
    generator + PatchGAN), **ssl** (SimCLR encoder + projection head, NT-Xent). Every task keeps
    the reproducibility guarantees by construction — the patient-level seed-locked split is
    task-independent, and each emitted `train.py` / `evaluate.py` passes `check_training_hygiene`
    (all RNGs seeded, cuDNN deterministic, train-only loader, `eval()` + `no_grad()`). The
    challenge + regression test now verify all 5 tasks (split + hygiene + valid Python, network-free).
  - **`/architecture-zoo` adds the `detection.md` and `synthesis.md` family cards** (R-CNN family /
    Faster R-CNN+FPN / Mask R-CNN / RetinaNet / YOLO / DETR; Pix2Pix / CycleGAN / SPADE / diffusion
    / VAE / fastMRI), each with the source paper, when-to-use, medical use, reference implementation,
    validation setup, and matching scaffold template; the decision-tree index now routes to them.

## [4.11.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added

- **find-journal:** acceptance-feasibility axis. A Phase 2.5 pre-flight
  (`assess_acceptance_readiness.py`, deterministic + reproducible challenge card)
  scans a manuscript for design-ceiling / unfixable-defect / importance-risk /
  claim-mismatch signals and a ceiling verdict (advisory risk band, never a
  probability). Adds two-axis ranking (scope fit × acceptance feasibility) with
  explicit mismatch surfacing, an `Acceptance Signals` profile schema
  (`references/acceptance_signals_schema.md`, populated for European Radiology, AJR,
  KJR, RYAI, Investigative Radiology), a reject-fallback cascade plan, and a
  desk-reject vs post-review distinction in Post-Rejection Mode. Helper named
  `assess_*` (not a detector-catalog member); counts unchanged (additive). (#215)
- **Medical-AI model-engineering lane — Phase 1 (validation MVP).** First slice of the v5.0
  "design → scaffold → validate → publish medical-AI model research" lane, led by the
  validation/reporting half (the build/scaffold half lands in a later phase). Clinician-anchored,
  torch-free, additive.
  - **New skill `/model-validation`** (Layer D, advisory + deterministic audit) — design or audit
    the clinical-validation study for an engineer-built medical-imaging model (segmentation /
    classification / detection): patient-level split disjointness + the data-leakage taxonomy,
    tuning-on-test, internal vs genuine external validation, comparator design, single-run vs
    multi-seed variance, task-correct metric selection (Metrics Reloaded), test-set sizing handoff
    to `/calc-sample-size`, and CLAIM 2024 / TRIPOD+AI / STARD-AI reporting fit. Integrates with
    MONAI / nnU-Net — does not replace them. Skills 45 → 46.
  - **New reviewer domain-probe `model_development.md` (MD0–MD8)** (`/peer-review` + `/self-review`,
    vendored byte-identical) — partition/leakage mechanics, tuning/threshold/model-selection on the
    test set, the internal-vs-external-validation conflation, seed/run variance, test-set event
    count, metric selection, reproducibility/provenance, and reference-standard/label quality.
    Domain-probe modules 15 → 16. Grounded in the leakage taxonomy (Kapoor & Narayanan, *Patterns*
    2023), Varoquaux & Cheplygina (*npj Digit Med* 2022), CLAIM 2024, and Metrics Reloaded
    (Maier-Hein & Reinke et al., *Nat Methods* 2024).
  - **New deterministic detector `check_split_leakage.py`** (`/model-validation`) — *proves* (by set
    arithmetic on the emitted `split_assignment.csv`, not heuristics) that no patient crosses
    train/val/test, and that the split records a reproducible seed. Verdicts `PATIENT_OVERLAP`
    (Major), `MISSING_SEED` (Major), `SINGLE_PARTITION` (Minor); train/validation/holdout synonyms
    collapse so a labelling variant never trips it. Stdlib-only, network-free, with a reproducible
    challenge card + CI-wired regression test. Integrity detectors 36 → 37.
- **Medical-AI model-engineering lane — Phase 2 (build/scaffold).** Completes the
  build → validate chain in-repo, staged after Phase 1's verification contract. Clinician-anchored
  (a *reproducible research scaffold generator that integrates MONAI / nnU-Net*, not a replacement);
  default CI stays torch-free.
  - **New skill `/model-scaffold`** (Layer B) — `scaffold.py` stamps out a runnable PyTorch
    segmentation training repo (configurable U-Net, `dataset.py`, `losses.py`, `train.py`,
    `evaluate.py`, `config.yaml`, `requirements.txt`, `REPRODUCIBILITY.md`, `methods_stub.md`) with
    the reproducibility guarantees baked in **by construction**: a patient-level seed-locked split
    written as an auditable artifact (`splits/split_assignment.csv` + `split_seed.txt`, disjoint by
    construction so it clears `/model-validation`'s `check_split_leakage`), all-RNG seeding + cuDNN
    determinism, a train-only loader, and `eval()` + `no_grad()` inference. No fabricated numbers
    (`[VERIFY]` placeholders). Skills 46 → 47.
  - **New deterministic detector `check_training_hygiene.py`** (`/model-scaffold`) — conservative
    AST linter (flag-not-prove, the training-code analogue of `check_generated_code`): all RNGs
    seeded, cuDNN deterministic, `eval()` + `no_grad()` inference, no training on a non-train split.
    Verdicts `SEED_INCOMPLETE` / `MISSING_EVAL_MODE` / `TRAIN_ON_NONTRAIN_SPLIT` (Major),
    `CUDNN_NONDETERMINISTIC` / `EVAL_SHUFFLE` (Minor). Integrity detectors 37 → 38.
  - **`scaffold_challenge`** executes the build → validate chain network-free: scaffold a repo →
    deterministic split matches the frozen expected + is patient-disjoint (proven inline) → passes
    `check_training_hygiene` → a **self-skipping** torch tier (forward shape + gradients + reproducible
    loss when torch is installed; `SKIP`, never CI coverage of runnability, when absent).
  - **New skill `/architecture-zoo`** (Layer D, advisory) — the *choose* front end of the lane: maps a
    research question (task + modality / dimensionality + labelled-data scale + class imbalance) to a
    **paper-grounded** architecture shortlist via a decision tree, then per-architecture cards with core
    idea, when-to-use, medical-imaging use, reference implementation, the typical validation/experiment
    setup, and the matching `/model-scaffold` template. Seeds the classification (ResNet / DenseNet /
    EfficientNet / Inception / ViT / Swin / DeiT), segmentation (U-Net / 3-D U-Net / V-Net / Attention
    & Residual U-Net / nnU-Net / SegResNet / Swin-UNETR / Mask R-CNN), and foundation/SSL (SAM / MedSAM /
    MedSAM2 / TotalSegmentator / SegVol / BiomedCLIP / DINO / MAE / SimCLR / MoCo) families. Every
    recommendation names its source paper; it teaches archetypes, not a live SOTA leaderboard. Skills
    47 → 48.
- **Medical-AI model-engineering lane — Phase 3 (reporting).** The documentation seam of the lane,
  after validation (Phase 1) and build (Phase 2). Clinician-anchored, additive.
  - **New skill `/model-card`** (Layer C) — generate the documentation an engineer-built model must
    carry: a **Model Card** (Mitchell et al., *FAccT* 2019), a dataset **Datasheet** (Gebru et al.,
    *CACM* 2021), and a **METRIC-informed data-quality pass** (Schwabe et al., *npj Digit Med* 2024),
    filled from user-supplied facts — never fabricated (intended use, out-of-scope use, training data,
    per-subgroup performance, caveats, provenance, consent, licence). Templates live in `references/`
    and are **uncounted** (documentation standards, not clinical reporting checklists — same treatment
    as `appraisal_tools/METRICS.md`), so `reporting_guidelines` is unchanged. Skills 48 → 49.
  - **New deterministic detector `check_model_card_complete.py`** (`/model-card`) — verifies every
    required Model Card / Datasheet section is **present and non-empty** (not missing, not an unfilled
    `[NEEDS INPUT]` placeholder). Verdicts `MISSING_SECTION` / `EMPTY_REQUIRED_SECTION` (Major); a
    presence check, not a truth check. `reporting_compliance` family. Integrity detectors 38 → 39.
  - Reproducible challenge (`check_model_card_complete_challenge`, synthetic complete + incomplete
    fixtures) + CI-wired regression test (8 cases).
- **Medical-AI model-engineering lane — Phase 4 (evaluation + MLLM).** The evaluation half, completing
  the choose → build → validate → evaluate → report chain. Clinician-anchored, additive.
  - **New skill `/model-evaluation`** (Layer B) — compute task-correct held-out metrics for a trained
    imaging model (segmentation: Dice + a boundary metric HD95/NSD per structure; classification: AUROC
    + AUPRC + sensitivity/specificity with bootstrap CIs at the deployment prevalence; detection: FROC/
    mAP with a stated IoU criterion) + calibration + subgroup slices, emitting a per-case table for
    `/analyze-stats`. `check_metric_reporting.py` gates the metric choice against Metrics Reloaded
    (Maier-Hein & Reinke et al., *Nat Methods* 2024) / CLAIM 2024 (`PIXEL_ACCURACY_SEG` /
    `NO_BOUNDARY_METRIC` / `ACCURACY_ONLY` / `DETECTION_METRIC_MISSING` / `CI_MISSING`). data_preparation
    family. Skills 49 → 50.
  - **New skill `/mllm-eval`** (Layer B) — a model-agnostic (closed API or open weights) evaluation
    harness for an LLM/MLLM on a clinical task (report generation, VQA, extraction): adjudicated
    reference standard, clinical-efficacy metrics (RadGraph-F1 / CheXbert-F1 beyond BLEU/ROUGE),
    faithfulness/hallucination, pretraining-contamination, prompt sensitivity, reader study.
    `check_mllm_eval_completeness.py` gates the plan (`NGRAM_ONLY` / `FAITHFULNESS_MISSING` /
    `REFERENCE_STANDARD_MISSING` / `CONTAMINATION_UNADDRESSED` / `READER_STUDY_MISSING` / …).
    reporting_compliance family. Skills 50 → 51.
  - **New reviewer domain-probe `mllm_evaluation.md` (ME0–ME8)** (`/peer-review` + `/self-review`,
    vendored byte-identical) — the reviewer-side audit of an LLM/MLLM clinical evaluation. Grounded in
    RadCliQ (Yu et al., *Patterns* 2023), RadGraph (Jain et al., NeurIPS 2021), CheXbert (Smit et al.
    2020), MedVH / Med-HALT, MI-CLEAR-LLM. Domain-probe modules 16 → 17. Integrity detectors 39 → 41.
  - **Uncounted appraisal ref** `appraisal_tools/METRICS_RELOADED.md` (metric-selection guidance; not a
    counted reporting checklist). Reproducible challenges + CI-wired regression tests for both detectors.

## [4.10.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added

- **Three new reviewer domain-probe modules** (`/peer-review` + `/self-review`, vendored
  byte-identical), reverse-engineered from high-IF CC-BY papers under the `reverse_engineer/`
  license firewall: **`mendelian_randomization.md`** (MR1–MR8: the three IV assumptions, a
  pleiotropy-robust sensitivity suite rather than IVW alone, Steiger/direction, sample overlap,
  non-linear-MR caution, drug-target colocalization); **`polygenic_risk_score.md`** (PG1–PG8:
  ancestry transferability/portability, base/target leakage, incremental value over the clinical
  model, screening detection-rate-vs-discrimination, target-population calibration);
  **`network_meta_analysis.md`** (NM1–NM8: transitivity, global+local incoherence, SUCRA/P-score
  over-interpretation, CINeMA/GRADE-NMA certainty, component-NMA additivity). Domain-probe modules
  12 → 15.
- **Observational probe O17** (`observational_confounding.md`) — agnostic many-exposure-scan
  multiplicity (ExWAS / EWAS / MWAS): correction matched to claim against the honest test-count
  denominator, independent replication as the real safeguard, correlated-exposure conservatism,
  selective top-hit reporting.
- **Two reporting-guideline checklists** (`/check-reporting`): **STROBE-MR** (Mendelian
  randomization) and **PGS-RS / PRS-RS** (polygenic-score risk prediction), with study-type
  routing + aliases. Reporting guidelines 36 → 38.
- **Four `/analyze-stats` analysis guides**: multiple-testing/high-dimensional screening,
  Mendelian randomization, polygenic risk score, and network meta-analysis.
- **`/clean-data` implausible-value & cross-field validity rules** reference — organ-system
  compatible-with-life bounds + cross-field logical-consistency rules (temporal ordering,
  derived-vs-source, sex-/state-specific), flag-not-auto-fix.

### Changed

- **Clinician-friendly update reminders.** The classroom installers
  (`install-macos.command` / `install-windows.cmd` / `install-windows.ps1`) now enable the in-app
  "update available" notice and the one-click Desktop updater by default (turnkey path; disable
  with `--disable-update-notify` or `MEDSCI_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`). For the `npx`/manual paths the
  installer prints a one-time nudge showing how to turn reminders on (`--enable-update-notify`),
  and the README Quick Start recommends it. New read-only `update.session_hook_enabled()` gates the
  nudge; the `npx`/manual paths stay opt-in (no silent SessionStart hook).

## [4.9.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added

- **Duplicate-bibliography gate** — new `check_reference_duplication.py`
  (`/manage-refs`, also usable from `/sync-submission`) reads the BUILT artifact
  (`.docx` via stdlib zipfile, or a rendered `.md`/`.txt`) and fires
  `DUP_REF_HEADING` / `REF_NUMBER_RESTART` / `REF_SIGNATURE_DUP` (Major) when the
  reference list is duplicated. Catches the hybrid failure where a manuscript
  carries both inline `[@key]` citations and a hand-typed `## References` list and
  is built with pandoc `--citeproc`: the build renders the hand list **and** a
  citeproc bibliography (often after the legends), so the same reference appears
  twice; `check_xref` does not see it. Author-anchored `(first-author, year)`
  signature detection works on Word auto-numbered lists. Validated against a real
  built docx with the duplicate (caught) and its single-list fix (clean).
  Stdlib-only; PII-free fixtures + `test_reference_duplication.sh`.

- **Cross-script binning-consistency gate** — new `check_binning_consistency.py`
  (`/self-review`, Phase 2.5b) parses analysis source (R/Python) and emits
  `BINNING_DRIFT` (Major) when one derived categorical (age band, BMI category,
  eGFR stage, risk tier) is binned with ≥2 different `(breaks, right-closure)`
  signatures across files. The same cohort then splits differently per script:
  per-stratum Ns drift between a primary table and a sensitivity table while the
  grand total still reconciles, so a row-sum check passes but a stratum can
  spuriously cross a threshold. Motivated by a screening cohort that binned age
  `right=FALSE` in the primary script vs `right=TRUE` in a threshold sensitivity
  script — fractional ages shifted hundreds of participants and produced a
  spurious "reached" stratum. Stdlib-only; PII-free fixtures +
  `test_binning_consistency.sh`.

  Together these two gates take the analysis-integrity detector suite **34 → 36**
  (citation family 6 → 7, data-preparation 5 → 6); skills and reporting guidelines
  unchanged. Additive and backward-compatible.

- **Float citation-order gate** — new `check_citation_order.py` (`/self-review`)
  flags numbered floats not cited in ascending order of first appearance, per series
  independently (main Tables, main Figures, Supplementary Tables, Supplementary
  Figures). It scans only the narrative body (auto-excluding the Figure Legends /
  back-matter so an in-order legends block cannot mask an out-of-order body) and
  tolerates plural lists ("Tables S4, S5"), ranges, and non-float sensitivity-spec
  labels ("S1–S6"). `CITATION_ORDER` (Major) is a pre-peer-review desk/technical-check
  item editorial offices "unsubmit" for; `CITATION_GAP` (Minor) flags non-contiguous
  numbering. Nonascending first citations can trigger a journal technical-check return. Wired into `/self-review`'s technical-check pass; synthetic
  positive/negative fixtures + regression test. Analysis-integrity detectors
  **33 → 34** (Reporting compliance family 8 → 9); skills 45 and reporting guidelines
  36 unchanged. Additive and backward-compatible.
- **Percentage-decimal style check + KJR technical-check conventions** — `/self-review`'s
  `check_classical_style.py` gains a `PERCENT_DECIMALS` verdict (Minor, report-only)
  flagging percentages reported to >1 decimal place ("35.14%"), which several journals
  (e.g. KJR) require at one decimal at technical check; regression fixture + test added.
  The KJR journal profile (`write-paper` detail + `find-journal` compact) gains a
  **Technical-Check Conventions** section enumerating the deterministic pre-review desk
  items that "unsubmit" a manuscript: ascending float citation order, demographics in
  Materials and Methods, one-decimal percentages, double spacing, Acknowledgments/Funding/
  Author-Contributions on the Title Page only, reporting checklist cited as "Supplementary
  Material 1", IRB number in Methods even when blinded, and ICMJE forms only after
  acceptance. No detector-count change (existing detector extended; profiles updated, not
  added). Check the current journal instructions when applying these conventions.

- **Audit-dump leak gate** — new `check_checklist_dump_leak.py` (`/sync-submission`)
  scans every `.md`/`.docx`/`.pdf` in a submission directory for the residue of a
  `/check-reporting` or `/self-review` *internal* audit report (`compliance_pct`,
  `fixable_by_ai`, `check_reporting_version`, `Auto-fix:`, `[PARTIAL→auto-fixed]`,
  `suggested_fix`, `Action Items`, `_pipeline_log`, `NON-AUTHORITATIVE`). Any hit is
  a **P0 leak**: these tooling tokens must never reach a reviewer. Motivated by a
  near-miss where a prior project's `STROBE_checklist_v4.pdf` was actually the
  check-reporting dump, reused by filename and compiled into the reviewer-visible
  proof (exposing auto-fix notes, raw JSON, and a stale old title). Wired into
  `preflight_gate.py` as a P0 check over the journal asset directory; writes
  `qc/checklist_dump_leak.json`. `/check-reporting` reports now also open with a
  `NOT-FOR-SUBMISSION` banner so the working audit is self-identifying.
  Analysis-integrity detectors **32 → 33**; skills 45 and reporting guidelines 36
  unchanged. Additive and backward-compatible.

- **Frontmatter schema gate (Agent Skills cross-platform portability)** — new
  `scripts/check_frontmatter_schema.py` + CI step strictly `yaml.safe_load`s every
  `skills/*/SKILL.md` frontmatter and enforces the published Agent Skills spec: valid
  YAML, `name` ≤64 chars / lowercase-hyphen / no reserved `claude`/`anthropic` token,
  `description` present / ≤1024 chars / no XML angle brackets. The repo's own generators
  use a tolerant line-based reader, so a frontmatter block that is not valid YAML could
  pass every prior gate yet be rejected by a strict-YAML consumer (the agentskills.io
  directory validator or another agent platform). Self-test (`tests/test_frontmatter_schema.sh`)
  covers each violation class. This is a repo-CI validator, not a counted detector.

### Changed

- **Skill-boundary documentation** — a diagnostic pass confirmed the 45 skills are
  deliberately specialized (no consolidation warranted), but several boundaries were
  easy to confuse. README's "Skills Work Together" now carries a **Skill boundaries**
  block spelling out the reference pipeline (`search-lit` → `lit-sync` → `manage-refs` →
  `verify-refs`), the language pass order (`humanize` → `polish-language` → `academic-aio`),
  manuscript-type selection (`write-paper` / `review-paper` / `revise`), author-vs-reviewer
  (`self-review` / `peer-review`), project entry (`intake-project` / `orchestrate`), study
  design (`design-study` perceptual ceiling gate / `design-ai-benchmarking`), and content
  vs template (`write-protocol` / `fill-protocol`). `/revise` now documents the manual
  fallback when `/analyze-stats` or `/make-figures` is unavailable (emit a checklist, hold
  responses as `BLOCKED — pending analysis/figure`, never invent numbers). Docs only.

- **`/analyze-stats` observational-design precondition** — Phase 2 (Analysis Plan) now opens
  with a WARN-level precondition: before planning an observational analysis (cohort,
  case-control, cross-sectional, registry, survey), confirm a literature-grounded
  `variable_operationalization.md` (from `/define-variables`) or equivalent codebook-backed
  definition table exists; if not, warn and recommend `/define-variables` first so
  exposure/outcome/covariate definitions and cutoffs are citation-backed rather than invented
  ad hoc from the data dictionary. WARN, not a hard block (proceed on explicit confirmation;
  stricter projects can treat it as a hard stop). Mirrors the precondition `/write-protocol`
  already enforces before drafting Methods, closing the one observational-pipeline skill that
  lacked it. Guidance only — non-breaking, no new code gate.

- **`/meta-analysis` progressive disclosure (token hygiene)** — the two inline "Empirical
  Lessons" sections (16 dated SR-MA peer-review lessons, ~45 lines) moved verbatim to
  load-on-demand `references/empirical_lessons.md`, with an explicit "load before Phase 4
  extraction-form design and before Phase 8 submission" pointer and a `Reference Files`
  entry — matching the skill's own established pattern (15 existing reference files). The
  largest SKILL.md in the bundle drops 804 → 775 lines (less context loaded on every
  activation); the lessons stay discoverable via the reference list. Content byte-preserved
  (no rewrite, no renumber — a pre-existing duplicate "9." label is carried over and noted in
  the reference file). No skill/detector count change.

- **De-drift the `sync-submission` YAML front-matter splitter** — `check_wordcount_cap.py`
  and `cover_letter_drift_check.py` each carried their own `_strip_yaml_front_matter`, marked
  "keep in sync" but already drifted (list vs tuple return; subtly different unclosed-fence
  handling). Extracted one canonical `split_yaml_front_matter()` into a private
  `scripts/_yaml_frontmatter.py` (leading underscore → not counted as a detector) imported by
  both — the helper ships in the same skill's `scripts/` dir, so it stays self-contained when
  vendored/installed. Behavior-preserving (verified normal / no-front-matter / unclosed cases
  + the wired `test_wordcount_cap` and `test_preflight_gate` subprocess-import path). No
  skill/detector count change.

### Fixed

- **Public-doc count reconciliation** — `README.md` (MedSci-Audit suite line) and
  `CITATION.cff` (abstract) cited stale catalog totals from before the detectors above
  merged (28 detectors / 32 EQUATOR guidelines). Reconciled to the disk SSOT
  (`metadata/catalog_counts.json`): **36 analysis-integrity detectors / 36 reporting
  guidelines**. Added a `What's New` "Unreleased" block to `README.md` so the public
  progression no longer implies v4.8 is current. No code or count change — the SSOT was
  already correct; only the prose was stale. Verified by `validate_catalog_consistency.py`.

- **`check_csl_render.py` hardening** (`/manage-refs`) — the CSL acceptance detector
  had five latent bugs that could surface a raw traceback or a silently-wrong verdict:
  it carried the two citekeys as module globals (`render()` was not standalone-callable),
  did not check pandoc's return code (a failed render was analyzed as if it succeeded),
  leaked `NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False)` temp files, imported `python-docx` deep inside
  a function, and read the `.bib` with an unguarded `open().read()`. Now: citekeys are
  passed as parameters, pandoc's return code (and a missing pandoc binary) raise a clear
  error and exit 2, all temp files live in a `TemporaryDirectory`, the `python-docx` import
  is guarded with an install hint, and a missing `.bib` reports `bib file not found`. No
  detector-count or behavior change on the happy path. New CI-wired regression test
  (`tests/test_csl_render.sh`, PII-free fixture) covers the error paths without requiring
  pandoc (the no-pandoc branch runs in CI; the render branch runs wherever pandoc exists).

- **CI test-coverage gap closure (15 dormant tests wired)** — fifteen skill regression
  tests shipped with their detectors but were never added to `.github/workflows/validate.yml`,
  so CI gave false coverage (`check-reporting` fail-fast / framework-naming / PRISMA-cascade,
  `manage-refs` duplicate-bibliography, `self-review` binning-consistency / citation-order /
  claim-artifact / panel-diversity / reviewer-team-consistency, `sync-submission` audit-dump-leak
  / copy-divergence / cross-document-N / scope-drift / vN-docx-assertion, `verify-refs`
  pagination-placeholder). All pass on the toolchain CI installs (stdlib + python-docx; no
  pandoc/R) and are now `run:` steps in `validate.yml`.

- **Dormant PRISMA Figure 1 detector activated** — `check_prisma_figure.py` (a counted
  MedSci-Audit detector implementing `/check-reporting` Step 4d's arithmetic + body↔figure
  cross-reference audit) existed and worked but was never invoked: Step 4d described the
  algorithm in prose and asked the model to extract numbers by hand. Step 4d now runs the
  deterministic script first (manual algorithm kept as the PNG/SVG-transcription fallback),
  with a new CI-wired test (`tests/test_prisma_figure.sh`, PII-free fixtures). The two
  `manage-refs` CSL tools surfaced by the same audit (`check_csl_render.py`,
  `fill_journal_abbrev.py`) are now documented in that skill's tool table.

- **`skills/MAINTENANCE.md`** — documents the four skill-script categories (counted detector /
  helper / run-once authoring tool / test fixture) and the wiring rules that prevent a detector
  or test from going dormant again (a detector must be invoked from SKILL.md and CI-tested; a
  test only counts as coverage if it is a `run:` step in `validate.yml`). No skill or detector
  count change.

- **`manage-project` frontmatter was not valid YAML** — its inline `description` ended with
  `Commands: init, status, …`, and the `: ` makes a plain inline scalar invalid YAML (a strict
  parser raises "mapping values are not allowed here"). The repo's tolerant reader accepted it,
  so it passed every prior gate, but a strict-YAML consumer would reject the skill. Quoted the
  description value (text unchanged; the storefront catalog first-sentence and per-skill docs are
  byte-identical). Found by the new frontmatter schema gate above.

## [4.8.0] - 2026-06-24

The **review-harvest batch**: deterministic detector hardening promoted from real-manuscript review
cycles — four false-positive fixes, two new gates, nine reviewer-side domain probes, and a
design-stage gate. **Additive and backward-compatible** — no skill, CLI, or output-path change;
skills 45 and reporting guidelines 36 unchanged; analysis-integrity detectors **30 → 32**.

### Added

- **Reader-facing supplement / multi-file hygiene gate** — new `check_supplement_hygiene.py`
  (`/self-review`) lints the rendered supplement, a separately-built tables file, and caption files
  (not just `manuscript.md`) for the technical-check-fatal residue that hides there: `§`/`§L` internal
  labels, unfilled placeholders (`Table SX`, `[Authors]`, figure-path globs, build-dir paths), build
  markers (`[VERIFY]`/`TODO`), response-to-reviewers framing, planning residue, and body↔supplement
  cross-reference numbers that don't resolve. `check_artifact_coverage.py` gains
  `PROMISED_STAT_NO_VALUE` + a `--supplement` corpus (a bound/ceiling/de-confounded statistic promised
  but never given a number anywhere). (#187)
- **Power-aware null-interpretation gate** — new `check_null_calibration.py` (`/self-review`)
  flags a headline negative/equivalence claim ("no synergy", "not associated") that carries no
  minimum-detectable-effect, power, equivalence-margin/TOST, or CI-compatibility statement. Plus a
  reusable `rating_monotonicity.py` template (`/analyze-stats`) that catches a folded
  confidence-weighted (call × confidence) → AUC encoding, and a `/design-study` design-stage ceiling
  gate for perceptual/reader-AI studies (6 ceiling-breakers set before data lock). (#188)
- **Nine reviewer-side domain probes** across the shared peer-review/self-review modules: SR/MA
  small-k enrollment-overlap, mixed-denominator pooling, prospective-registration chronology, and
  boundary-degenerate proportions (P14–P17); observational selection-on-availability and
  serial-imaging lesion-tracking (O15/O16); diagnostic exclusion-flow ↔ prose + modality-safety (D8);
  AI arm-task-vs-deployment-workflow (AO6); and a survival apparent-vs-optimism deterministic tell
  (S7). (#186)
- **Integrity detector count: 30 → 32.**

### Fixed

- **Four detector false positives** that fired Major on legitimate (often recommended) patterns:
  `check_generated_code` no longer flags a hex-color palette (the colorblind-safe WONG palette
  `make-figures` recommends) as hand-typed tabular data; `check_classical_style` fires the `§` AI-tell
  only on a section cross-reference, not on author-footnote daggers; `check_scope_coherence` clears
  `CROSS_SECTIONAL_PROGNOSTIC` when the prognostic token sits inside a negation/deferral frame; and
  `check_cohort_arithmetic` no longer mis-binds the `RATE_BACKCALC` numerator to a tier label's digit
  or a decimal's fraction. Each ships a regression fixture; three previously-unwired test suites are
  now CI-wired. (#185)

### Changed

- **Release pipeline now also publishes to npm** (idempotent, with npm provenance via OIDC), so the
  `npx medsci-skills@latest install` channel no longer drifts behind the GitHub release. The step runs
  only when the `NPM_TOKEN` repo secret is set, skips if that version is already on npm (re-running a
  tag is safe), and runs after the GitHub Release so an npm hiccup never blocks it. No product change.

## [4.7.0] - 2026-06-22

The **self-update foundation**: physician-researchers stay current without GitHub, git, or a
terminal — via a transactional crash-safe installer, a verified one-click updater, a hardened
release pipeline, and an opt-in update notice. **Additive and backward-compatible** — no skill, CLI,
or output-path change; skills 45 and reporting guidelines 36 unchanged. All four pieces are
network-mocked-tested and run on Ubuntu + macOS + Windows CI.

### Added

- **Transactional, crash-recoverable installer + per-target state.** `install.py` now installs each
  target through a durable **journal state machine** (`installers/medsci_txn.py`,
  `prepared → old_moved → new_installed → committed`, atomic-write + `fsync`): an interrupted install
  is recovered on the next run (roll back an incomplete transaction, forward-clean a committed one,
  **fail closed** on a corrupt journal). It keeps a per-target installed manifest at
  `~/.medsci-skills/targets/<target>/` with a **per-skill SHA-256 inventory** — a skill you modified
  is snapshotted to `~/.medsci-skills/backups/<ts>/` before an update, legacy collisions are backed up
  there (never inside the skills dirs, never auto-deleted), and only MedSci-owned skills are pruned
  (your/third-party skills are untouched). Adds **canonical-home containment** path-safety, a
  disk-space preflight, two deterministic tracked manifests
  (`metadata/distribution_manifest.json` ownership/version + `metadata/distribution_files.json`
  payload inventory) with a CI `--check` gate, and a Windows/macOS CI matrix. (#177)
- **One-click self-updater (`installers/update.py`).** Fetches the latest classroom release and
  re-installs through the transactional installer — no GitHub UI, git, or terminal. Resolves the
  release via **`api.github.com` only** and **fails closed** if the API has no sha256 digest; verifies
  the download's sha256 == the API digest, the asset name, and the tag; and **never `extractall()`s** —
  it extracts per entry, rejecting path traversal (POSIX + Windows), symlink/hardlink/junction,
  case-insensitive duplicates, and zip-bombs, and enforcing the `distribution_files.json` allowlist +
  per-file hash. Installs the updater to `~/.medsci-skills/updater/` (survives deleting the download
  folder); `install.py --check-update` reports availability via semver with a clock-sane 24h cache;
  optional consented `--desktop-launcher`. Thin `.command`/`.cmd` launchers wrap it; a privacy notice
  (`docs/update_privacy.md`) states the honest scope. (#178)
- **Release-pipeline supply-chain hardening.** `release.yml` now gates on a version-consistency check
  (the pushed tag must equal `CITATION.cff` == `package.json` == `metadata/distribution_manifest.json`
  and the tracked inventory must match the tree); injects a verified `provenance.json`
  `{schema_version, tag, version, git_sha, built_at}` into each classroom ZIP via
  `build_classroom_release.py --tag/--git-sha/--built-at`; attests the ZIPs' build provenance
  (`actions/attest-build-provenance`); runs on a protected `release` environment (required-reviewer
  approval); and — via the new `scripts/check_release_zip.py` — verifies each ZIP round-trips through
  the **updater's own** safe-extract + provenance validation before publishing, so a release can never
  ship a ZIP the self-updater would reject (locked by `installers/tests/test_release_zip.sh`).
  `provenance.json` stays a control file (excluded from the safe-extract inventory). `SECURITY.md`
  gains a "Release integrity & revocation" section; `docs/maintainer_workflow.md` documents the
  protected-environment setup. (#179)
- **Opt-in update notice for Claude Code (off by default).** `install.py --enable-update-notify`
  merges a SessionStart hook (`installers/session_update_check.py`) into `~/.claude/settings.json`
  that prints a one-line "update available" `systemMessage` at session start; `--disable-update-notify`
  removes only that hook (keying on the home-anchored script path, so it never touches a foreign hook).
  The hook **does not read the SessionStart stdin** (no cwd/transcript/session id), has no
  telemetry/analytics/unique-id, uses the shared clock-sane 24h cache + a 4 s timeout, stays silent on
  any error (never blocks a session), honors `MEDSCI_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`, and installs nothing — it
  only notifies. A version *check* resolves the latest tag without the OS-specific download asset
  (`resolve_latest_tag`), so the notice works on Linux too; the settings merge is idempotent, preserves
  foreign hooks/settings, and refuses to clobber an unparseable `settings.json`. Tested offline
  (`installers/tests/test_session_hook.py`, 38 cases). (#180)

### Trust boundary (honest scope)

- Running a release's bundled installer **is remote code execution within the GitHub trust boundary**.
  The digest and the build-provenance attestation detect **transport / asset tampering** — they do
  **not** defend against a compromised publisher account or a malicious official release. See
  `SECURITY.md` and `docs/update_privacy.md`.

## [4.6.0] - 2026-06-21

A maintainability, governance, and review-depth release. **Integrity detectors 28 → 30; domain probes 11 → 12; skills 45 and reporting guidelines 36 unchanged.** No skill rename, CLI, or output-path change — additive and backward-compatible.

### Added

- **Fairness / equity / subgroup-performance domain probe (`equity_fairness.md`, EQ0–EQ6).** Vendored byte-identical into `/peer-review` and `/self-review` (`MODULES` 11 → 12). Fires only when a manuscript claims cross-population performance or presents subgroup analyses as a fairness argument: disaggregated subgroup metrics (not aggregate-only), error-rate-vs-discrimination parity and base-rate dependence, a named fairness estimand + between-group gap test, development-cohort representativeness, subgroup EPV/power, and equity-aware framing aligned to TRIPOD+AI / DECIDE-AI / CONSORT-AI. (#170)
- **AI-disclosure + data/code-availability detector (`sync-submission/check_disclosure_availability.py`).** An AI-use disclosure must carry four tokens — version + access channel + date/date-range + responsible party (the tool name only triggers the check) — plus Data/Code Availability presence with a repository/DOI where the journal expects one, keyed by `journal_availability_policy.json`. (#171)
- **Structured-summary-box conformance detector (`academic-aio/check_summary_box.py`).** Key Points bullet count + one-claim-per-bullet, Research-in-context's three sub-blocks, and plain-language word band, journal-keyed via `summary_box_specs.json` — catches the wrong-format box a production technical check rejects. (#171)
- **Skill `maturity` taxonomy (`official` / `experimental` / `community`).** A required, additive `skill.yml` v2.2 field (`schema_version` stays 2), enforced by `validate_skill_contracts.py` and surfaced in `skills_catalog.json`; all 45 current skills are `official`. (#174)
- **Governance & answer-engine docs:** `ROADMAP.md` (priorities + explicit out-of-scope), `MAINTAINERS.md` (clinical authority stays with the founder), `SECURITY.md` (vulnerability reporting + medical-scope boundary), `docs/maintainer_workflow.md` (review + release checklist), `docs/faq.md` (AEO/GEO), and two new issue templates (installation problem, detector request). (#173)

### Changed

- **Positioning leads with the compliance moat.** README hero subline and the marketplace source description (`MARKETPLACE_DESCRIPTION`) now lead with reporting-guideline + risk-of-bias compliance, reference verification, and deterministic integrity gates rather than skill count. README gains a "What is MedSci Skills?" answer block, a "Start here: 3 workflows" section, and a "Validation status" section (available vs CI-gated vs E1-evaluated). A stale "32 EQUATOR" hero count was corrected to "36 reporting guidelines and risk-of-bias tools". (#173, #174)
- **`write-paper` Phase 7 token diet (pilot).** The three integrity-audit sub-steps (7.3a/7.3b/7.3c) moved to `references/phase7_integrity_audits.md` behind a control-flow-preserving pointer; measured −10,238 chars (~2,559 tokens) per invocation, loaded on demand only when Phase 7 runs. (#172)

### Documentation

- `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the PR template add a medical-claim → founder-review gate and an official/experimental/community classification line; `IMPACT.md` adds an "Interpretation of metrics" caveat block ("early community interest, not widespread adoption"). (#173)

### Validation / Evidence

- New deterministic scripts each ship a network-free challenge/regression test wired into CI. `MEDSCI_AUDIT.md` detector-count claims corrected (it had drifted to 27/28) and a `DETECTOR_CLAIM_FILES` gate added to `validate_catalog_consistency.py` (anchored current-total patterns, never historical evaluation numbers) so the total cannot silently drift again. A regression test for the routing-asset gate (`tests/test_routing_assets.sh`) covers the references/ pointer that guards the Phase-7 extraction. (#169, #171)

## [4.5.0] - 2026-06-20

### Added

- **Self-review domain-probe batch (SR/MA + DTA + prediction-model) + submission asset-anon abs-path gate.** Five new review probes promoted from field cycles, plus one deterministic submission check. `sr_ma.md`: **P12** risk-of-bias table row-sum ↔ figure-matrix reconciliation (each NOS ★/JBI Y row must equal its printed total; the traffic-light figure's data matrix must match the supplementary table; SSOT = the primary appraisal form, not a plotting-script constant) and **P13** included-study ↔ reference-list completeness (every characteristics-table study must be a numbered reference; source citations from PubMed `efetch`, not hand-kept notes; disambiguate same author/year by technique + sample size). `diagnostic_accuracy.md`: **D7** index-test-as-enrollment-criterion circularity (escalate past Major when an inclusion threshold is the index test under study). `clinical_prediction_model.md`: **CP5** intended-use horizon leakage (claim-timepoint adjectives vs each predictor's availability timepoint) and **CP6** validation-nomenclature conflation (development/CV vs held-out/external test). Probes are vendored byte-identical to `peer-review`. `sync-submission/scripts/check_asset_anonymization.py`: new scan class 4 — a `word/*.xml` attribute (e.g. a pandoc-embedded image's `<pic:cNvPr descr="…">`) carrying an absolute home-dir path (`/Users/…`, `/home/…`) is a username leak invisible to a rendered-text scan; flagged as `docx_embedded_abs_path` (leak severity), with a regression test fixture. No version bump — probe/reference + detector additions.
- **`/clean-data` + `/analyze-stats` — reverse-coded-item / negative-alpha detector (integrity detectors 27 → 28).** A multi-item Likert scale with a negatively-worded item must recode it `(min+max) - x` before the scale total or Cronbach's alpha is computed; left un-recoded, the item correlates negatively with the rest of the scale and alpha collapses (often *negative*). A negative alpha is a coding bug, not a "multidimensional construct" — defending it as such loses a review round. New stdlib-only `skills/clean-data/scripts/check_reverse_coding.py` computes per-item corrected item-total (item-rest) correlations + the raw Cronbach's alpha and returns `REVERSE_CODING_LIKELY` (alpha < 0) / `REVERSE_CODING_SUSPECT` (negative item-rest, alpha ≥ 0) / `OK`, exit 1 under `--strict`. `skills/analyze-stats/references/templates/likert_summary.py` is hardened to print item-rest correlations, flag negative ones as reverse-code suspects, warn loudly on a negative alpha, and apply the recode via a new `--reverse-items` flag before scoring/alpha. Ships a synthetic fixture (a 3-item scale with one reverse item → raw α = −1.71, plus a clean aligned scale) + CI-wired regression test (`skills/clean-data/tests/test_reverse_coding.sh`). Detector mapped to the `data_preparation` family; `metadata/detectors_catalog.json` regenerated; `catalog_counts.json::integrity_detectors` 27 → 28. Motivation: a medical-education pilot whose Trust scale shipped at α = −0.57 (one reverse item un-recoded) and consumed a major-revision round before `6 - x` restored α = 0.58.

- **Test backfill (cont.) — `fill-protocol` + `fulltext-retrieval` regression tests (Tier 1 complete).** `skills/fill-protocol/tests/test_fill_form.sh` builds a synthetic Word template at runtime (python-docx: 2-column key/value table + numbered section headers + title paragraph), runs `fill_form.py` with a content YAML exercising `table_kv`/`section_replace`/`paragraph_replace`, and asserts the values landed in the reopened docx, the title placeholder was replaced, and an absent label is reported `[MISS]` — no committed binary fixture. `skills/fulltext-retrieval/tests/test_pdf_to_md.py` stubs `pymupdf4llm` before import (the module exits on a missing dep) and pins the dependency-free helpers `parse_page_range` (ranges/lists/whitespace) and `clean_markdown` (collapse 4+ newlines, rstrip lines, single trailing newline, idempotent) — no heavy PyMuPDF dependency added to CI. Both use deps already present (python-docx/pyyaml; stdlib). No skill/version change — test infrastructure only.
- **Test backfill (cont.) — `fill-icmje-coi` + `academic-aio` regression tests.** Three more deterministic, network-free tests wired into CI. `skills/fill-icmje-coi/tests/test_fill_icmje_coi.sh` clones the shipped synthetic seed for two authors and asserts the documented contract per output docx (14 checked boxes, 13 "None" disclosures, new title/date substituted, author name present, zero placeholder leakage; stdlib zipfile path). `skills/academic-aio/tests/test_validate_schema.sh` checks the JSON-LD validator (valid ScholarlyArticle passes; wrong `@context`, unknown `@type`, missing required field, malformed DOI each fail). `skills/academic-aio/tests/test_batch_metadata_audit.sh` checks the repo/HF-card auditor (clean repo passes `--fail-on-issue`; missing README/CITATION/LICENSE fails; report-only mode stays exit 0; a PHI-shaped string in an HF card is flagged). All fixtures synthetic. No skill/version change — test infrastructure only.
- **Test backfill — Tier 0 CI-wiring + `deidentify` PHI-scan regression test.** Ten skill regression tests that existed on disk but were never gated are now wired into `.github/workflows/validate.yml`, so a silent break fails CI: `make-figures` (legend reconcile), `clean-data` (structural-zero), `lit-sync` (poll logic), `meta-analysis` (pool consistency), `generate-codebook`, `present-paper` (speaker-notes markdown), `version-dataset` (manifest/verify), `manage-refs` (vN-docx cross-ref), and `polish-language` (consistency-linter challenge). New `skills/deidentify/tests/test_deidentify_scan.sh` asserts the exact PHI-classification contract (PHI/REVIEW_NEEDED/SAFE counts + `rrn` phi_type) on the three committed fixtures — the CSV scan path is stdlib-only and network-free, and the test file is Hangul-free (column-specific asserts read the fixture header at runtime). CI now installs pandas/numpy/python-pptx/python-docx up front (was: pandas installed after the gates, which would silently skip the dep-guarded tests); `version-dataset` gains a pandas skip-guard for local robustness. No skill/version change — test infrastructure only.

## [4.4.0] - 2026-06-20

### Added

- **`/peer-review` + `/self-review` — Image-Synthesis / Cross-Modality Generation probe module (IS1–IS4) + reviewer-side reference-integrity spot-check.** New domain-probe module `image_synthesis.md` (vendored byte-identical into `/self-review`; `MODULES` 10 → 11, sync gate updated) for studies that synthesize one imaging modality from another (MRI→PET / MRI→CT / non-contrast→contrast / low-dose→full-dose) and claim the output carries functional/molecular information or substitutes for the unavailable target. **IS1** determinism/information-ceiling (the synthetic image is a deterministic function of the source, so a same-reader "source + synthetic > source alone" gain is a presentation/interpretability effect absent a direct source→label baseline); **IS2** target-derived-preprocessing / undescribed slice-selection leakage (a lesion mask drawn on the target modality guiding slice selection or training makes "function inferred from structure" circular — undescribed provenance is itself a Major #1 candidate); **IS3** global-vs-lesion-level quantitative agreement (whole-organ SUVR agreement does not establish lesion-level fidelity); **IS4** mechanistic/proxy-signal plausibility (name what the source physically measures vs the target's biology — high image similarity is not evidence an unmeasured signal was recovered). Routed from a new peer-review **Phase 2K** + Phase 3 QC item 15 + Phase 5 routing line, and a `/self-review` routing-table row. Per Phase 2F, IS2/IS4 are typically unfixable-in-current-form and govern the recommendation toward Reject-leaning. Companion **reviewer-side reference-integrity spot-check** added to the Phase 2 issue checklist + Phase 3 QC item 16 (all original-research reviews): spot-check the load-bearing Introduction/Discussion citations used *as evidence the method/premise works* — a paper cited for a different task, a duplicate reference, a wrong year/author — phrasing unconfirmed suspicions "please verify" (the reviewer-side mirror of the authoring citation-safety discipline). Motivation: a decision-audit of a cross-modality MRI→synthetic-PET reader-study review where the three structurally distinct synthesis failure modes were split across reviewers and the reference-list errors went uncaught on the reviewer side.
- **`/author-strategy` — trajectory-archetype classification (optional, explainable multi-label heuristic).** Adds an opt-in capability that classifies a queried author's PubMed trajectory into abstract career archetypes (A1 infrastructure builder, A2 methodology rule-maker, A3 clinical→AI hybrid, A4 SR/MA volume engine, A5 large-consortium participation pattern, A6 clinical-subspecialty device/technique depth, plus a computed A3+A6 composite). The rubric is a single canonical data file (`references/trajectory_archetypes.yaml`); the narrative `references/trajectory_archetypes.md` is generated from it by `render_archetype_doc.py` (`--check` gate). Each label carries a 0–1 score (computable-signal-weight denominator; `unavailable` signals — h-index/citation/venue-tier — are excluded and surfaced as `[VERIFY]`, never fabricated), a confidence band capped per archetype, and evidence drawn from the author's own PMIDs (`evidence_pmids` for per-paper signals, `evidence_summary` for corpus-level); a negative rule suppresses a label to `insufficient evidence`. A **disambiguation gate** precedes classification: `fetch_pubmed.py` writes a `corpus_manifest.json` cryptographically bound to the CSV (`csv_sha256` + `pmid_set_hash`) and `classify_archetypes.py` refuses to run unless `review_status: approved` and the hashes match — a surname alone never resolves an author, and `--approve` is a human gate. Target-author attribution (ORCID/affiliation/initials/position) is split into a stdlib-only `pubmed_parse.py` and never borrows a co-author's metadata on a same-surname collision; author position is reported as a `first/middle/last/unknown` positional heuristic (not leadership metadata), and `analyze_patterns.py`'s "Leadership rate" is renamed "First/last positional rate". The output header states the labels are explainable heuristics, not objective classifications. Ships name-free synthetic fixtures + a CI-gated regression test (A14). Skill count unchanged — an enhancement, not a new skill.
- **`/verify-refs` — OpenAlex tertiary index (conference-proceedings / non-DOI recovery).** PubMed covers only biomedical literature and CrossRef's proceedings coverage is uneven, so NeurIPS / ICLR / ACL-style citations — common in medical-AI manuscripts — fall through both and were marked `UNVERIFIED`. After the PubMed and CrossRef tiers, `verify_refs.py` now consults OpenAlex (`https://api.openalex.org`, free, no API key) **only when no authoritative author list was obtained yet** (a reference already resolved by PubMed/CrossRef incurs no extra call). It resolves by DOI when present, otherwise by a token-similarity-guarded title search so a fabricated title cannot earn a spurious `OK`. This is the free analogue of the second index (e.g. Scopus) that journal portals run alongside CrossRef. Because OpenAlex display names carry no structured family/given field and mix `First Last` with `Last, First` forms, OpenAlex-sourced authors support an existence check plus a tolerant first-author *membership* check but **never** drive the strict positional or author-count MISMATCH (reserved for PubMed efetch / CrossRef); an OpenAlex miss is `UNVERIFIED`, never `FABRICATED`. New `--no-openalex` flag restricts verification to PubMed + CrossRef. Ships a network-free regression test (`tests/test_openalex_tier.sh`, monkeypatched `http_json`, CI gate A8b). Motivation: a medical-AI reference list where two NeurIPS citations validated on Scopus but not CrossRef in a journal portal's reference check.

## [4.3.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- **Observational / cohort probe + gate hardening** (sourced from two cross-sectional health-screening cohort self-review→revise loops). Expands `observational_confounding.md` **O1–O6 → O1–O9** (vendored byte-identical into `/self-review`): **O7 — over-adjustment** (conditioning on a mediator or consequence of the outcome — the opposite-direction failure to O1, e.g. a renally-excreted lab in an eGFR model; "adjust for everything that differs in Table 1" is not a confounder-selection rule), **O8 — analysis unit & clustering** (records vs unique subjects → anti-conservative CIs), **O9 — outcome construct validity** for report-/registry-derived outcomes (composite homogeneity, ascertainment/κ, dictionary-first label provenance, misclassification direction). O1 also gains an **exposure-defining-covariate exemption** for guideline-defined exposures and a reference-arm-contamination-vs-selection-bias note (O3); `check_confounding_completeness.py` now **computes SMD from per-stratum mean ± SD** when the wide Table 1 carries no p / SMD column (interop with `/analyze-stats`).
- **New domain-probe module `clinical_prediction_model.md` (CP1–CP4)** for cross-sectional / observational prediction models (TRIPOD / TRIPOD+AI nested predictor-set comparisons): apparent-vs-optimism-corrected calibration/DCA, the incremental-value-vs-marginal-effect **two-null distinction**, EPV per nested model, and net benefit as a model comparison (not a policy endorsement). Vendored byte-identical into `/self-review`; `MODULES` 9 → 10; routed from peer-review (new Phase 2E-2) and self-review. Plus two `/self-review` `exemplar_findings/` (`over_adjustment_collider.md`, `prediction_two_null_conflation.md`).
- **Cohort-analysis probes (G39–G41).** `survival_prognostic.md` gains **S9 — panel-data / multistate variance** (occupancy/intensity CIs must be person-clustered or person-bootstrapped, not naive model-based on within-person-correlated visit transitions; S1–S8 → S1–S9). `observational_confounding.md` gains **O10 — overlapping-subset gradient** (an effect-size gradient across nested/overlapping cohorts is attributable by construction; inferential "attenuated/accounted-for" language needs a difference/interaction test; O1–O9 → O1–O10). Both vendored byte-identical into `/self-review`. Plus an **extended-adjustment missingness-frame** discipline (compare adjusted vs unadjusted on the *same* reduced complete-case frame, not the full-frame anchor) in `/self-review` Phase 2.5e + `/analyze-stats` over-adjustment guidance.
- **Cross-sectional survey-epidemiology probes (G45–G46, paper-driven from CC-BY NHANES cohorts).** `observational_confounding.md` gains **O11 — complex-survey design & weighting** (NHANES/KNHANES/CHNS: design-based estimation with the correct/scaled weight + stratification + PSU, subpopulation-domain-not-row-deletion, weighted total is a population estimate not a sample n, design-effect/effective-n) and **O12 — data-driven threshold / non-linearity mining** (a recursive-search 'inflection point' / 'saturation effect' needs a breakpoint CI + pre-specified non-linearity test + stability check, not a quoted cutoff). O1–O10 → O1–O12, vendored byte-identical into `/self-review`. `/analyze-stats` `survey_weighted.md` gains a subpopulation-domain (never row-delete) + survey-reporting-errors block.
- **Cross-sectional mediation probe (G47, paper-driven from CC-BY mediation papers).** `observational_confounding.md` gains **O13 — cross-sectional mediation (temporal order & sequential ignorability)**: a Baron–Kenny / Sobel / PROCESS / bootstrapped indirect-effect chain estimated on single-timepoint data cannot establish the X→M→Y sequence (the bootstrap CI addresses sampling variability, not identification); needs an unmeasured-mediator–outcome-confounding sensitivity analysis (e.g. an E-value for the indirect effect) + a temporal-order caveat, and proportion-mediated is unstable when the total effect is small. O1–O12 → O1–O13, vendored byte-identical into `/self-review`; adds `exemplar_findings/cross_sectional_mediation.md`.
- **Cleanup batch (G48/G42/G43).** `/analyze-stats` gains a **mediation analysis guide** (`analysis_guides/mediation.md` + SKILL entry): bootstrapped a×b indirect effect, proportion-mediated only with uncertainty, AGReMA reporting, and the discipline that identification (no unmeasured mediator–outcome confounding → E-value for the indirect effect) — not the bootstrap — is the issue (pairs O13). `/sync-submission` gains **`scripts/assemble_supplement.py`** (NOT an integrity detector): validates an `S{N}_*.md` + index supplement (index↔file 1:1, duplicate/skipped sub-section numbers), rebuilds `_combined.md` in index order, and reports main-text callout coverage. `/render-pdf-doc` gains **`scripts/scan_glyph_coverage.py`** + a Step 3.5 pre-render scan for the xelatex silent-glyph-drop failure (arrows / − ≤ ≥ ± √ / Greek / ★ ✓ / CJK; optional `fonttools` cmap check). Both ship fixtures + CI-wired tests (A12/A13). Integrity-detector count unchanged (27).
- **Interaction-scale probe (G49, paper-driven from CC-BY joint-effect papers).** `observational_confounding.md` gains **O14 — interaction scale (additive vs multiplicative)**: a synergy / joint-effect / effect-modification claim is an additive-scale statement and needs **RERI / AP / synergy index with CIs**, not a multiplicative-only OR product term, joint-category ORs, or stratified-only estimates (the difference-in-significance fallacy). O1–O13 → O1–O14, vendored byte-identical into `/self-review`; `/analyze-stats` gains an Interaction & Effect-Modification entry (RERI/AP/S, Knol & VanderWeele). The cross-sectional-cohort review lane (O1–O14 + CP1–CP4 + S9 + gates) is now comprehensive.
- **`check_cohort_arithmetic.py` — new `ANALYSIS_UNIT_UNDISCLOSED` check** (`--id-col`, auto-detect with a cardinality guard): when records > unique subjects and the manuscript discloses neither the analysis unit nor a one-record-per-subject sensitivity, emits a Major with a `records / unique_subjects / repeat_subjects / max_visits` reconciliation (probe O8).
- **`check_scope_coherence.py` — new `CROSS_SECTIONAL_YIELD_LANGUAGE` lexicon** (Minor): a cross-sectional / prevalence design using incidence-flavored vocabulary ("yield", "detection rate", "number-needed-to-screen/image", "rescreen interval") without defining "yield" once as cross-sectional report-positive prevalence.
- **New detector `check_paren_spans.py`** (`/self-review`, integrity detectors **26 → 27**, family *Style & review-process*) — a post em-dash→paren-conversion safety scan (cohort-cycle follow-up): a bulk `— X —` → `(X)` edit can pair two *unrelated* dashes across a sentence boundary and wrap a whole sentence — or an ordinal limitation ("Sixth, …") — inside one parenthesis, paren-balanced so a balance check misses it. Flags `PAREN_SPAN_ORDINAL` and `PAREN_SPAN_SENTENCE` (long spans only, so short legitimate parentheticals like "(Dr. Smith)", "(Fig. 2)", "(95% CI …)" are clean). Wired into `/self-review` `--fix` post-edit and `/humanize` pattern 13. Fixtures + regression test (CI-gated).
- **New detector `check_wordcount_cap.py`** (`/sync-submission`, integrity detectors **25 → 26**, family *Reporting compliance*) — the **revision-inflation trap**: a revise loop monotonically adds words and silently breaches the target journal's body cap. Counts the body (Introduction → Discussion, skipping abstract/refs/tables/declarations), compares to a cap from `--limit` or a parsed `--journal-profile` article-type line, and emits `WORDCOUNT_OVER_CAP` (Major) / `WORDCOUNT_NEAR_CAP` (Minor, >0.95×). The binding number is the rendered count (citeproc expands `[@key]`), so it prefers `--rendered-words N` and otherwise estimates from the markdown body + inline-citation expansion. Wired as `/sync-submission` Gate 13, a `/revise` exit gate (re-run after every pass), and a `/self-review` §F check. Ships fixtures + regression test.

### Fixed

- **`verify_refs.py` — corporate/collective-author render-abort fix (cohort-cycle follow-up).** A guideline body double-braced in BibTeX (`{{EASL} and {EASD}}`, `{{KDIGO CKD Work Group}}`) or returned by PubMed as `<CollectiveName>` tripped the first-author cross-check as MISMATCH, which **aborted `render_pandoc.sh` on every guideline-citing cohort manuscript**. Corporate authors are now detected (surviving brace / `<CollectiveName>` / organization keyword) and exempted from the personal-name family cross-check (annotated `corporate/collective author`, never MISMATCH). Personal-author entries are unaffected.
- **`check_classical_style.py` — em-dash counter counts prose only (cohort-cycle follow-up).** It excludes structural dashes — markdown table cells (incl. "—" N/A placeholders and `(A) —` panel-label captions), ORCID separators, and author/affiliation lines — and reports prose-vs-structural separately, so a cohort manuscript with large baseline tables is not pushed into destructive edits on correct table dashes.
- **`check_confounding_completeness.py` — DB-column-code ↔ prose alias map.** A DB-exported Table 1 carrying column codes (`he_sbp`, `b_uric`, `b_chol_hdl`) was false-flagged as imbalanced-and-unadjusted when the adjustment set was written in prose ("systolic blood pressure"). An alias map now resolves both to a shared concept; it only ever *adds* matches (no new false ✓). Genuinely unadjusted covariates still flag.
- **`check_confounding_completeness.py` — exposure-defining-covariate exemption (O1 false-positive on guideline-defined exposures).** For a guideline-defined exposure (MASLD / metabolic syndrome / CKM / sarcopenia / frailty), the components of its own diagnostic criteria (BMI, glycaemia, lipids, BP) are imbalanced *by construction* and correctly unadjusted — the gate flagged each as a Major. New `--exposure-defining-list/-file` marks these `EXPOSURE_DEFINING_EXEMPT` (adjusting for them is over-adjustment, probe O7), so the Major remains only for genuine non-defining prognostic covariates. O1 wording updated; also a fixed `_pick_col` substring bug (a 1–2-char hint like "p" matched an unrelated column such as "exposed").

### Changed

- **`/self-review`** — adds a **difference-in-significance discipline** check (§C; "stronger in A (p<0.05) than B (p=NS)" without a formal interaction test), **statistic-type fidelity** and **stale-derived-CSV (n-mismatch)** checks (Phase 2.5a), **`POWER_MODEL_MISSPEC` / `POWER_VALUE_INTERPOLATED`** (Phase 2.5a-2; the power/MDE simulation must use the primary-model adjustment set and not be interpolated), an additive **`requires_reanalysis`** issue-schema field that routes data-level fixes to `/analyze-stats` instead of a prose `--fix` (Phase 4), and **re-run-the-panel-after-a-large-revision** guidance (Phase 2.6).
- **`/analyze-stats`** — over-adjustment covariate-selection guidance for cross-sectional outcome models, and a **Table 1 mean(SD)-vs-median(IQR) rule by `|skewness|>1`** (not a mean−median/SD heuristic) coupled to Wilcoxon / t-test.
- **`/check-reporting`** — STROBE common-gap items: power-aware framing of a null result, and confounder-selection rationale (no kitchen-sink / no outcome-consequence adjustment).
- **`/write-paper`** — observational-cohort Discussion exemplar gains power-aware null framing and an over-adjustment limitation.
- **`/revise`** — `requires_reanalysis` self-review findings auto-route to `/analyze-stats`; adds a Body-word-count-vs-cap exit gate (re-run `check_wordcount_cap.py` after every pass).
- **`/self-review`** — `--panel` now treats the SSOT-singularity gate (Phase 1 step 4) as a **blocking precondition**: if >1 manuscript-like `.md` exists and none is pinned (`SSOT.yaml` / `--ssot`), it halts before spawning reviewers rather than risk a whole panel on a stale copy.

No skill / reporting-guideline count change (45 / 36); integrity detectors 25 → 27 (`check_wordcount_cap`, `check_paren_spans`).

## [4.2.0] - 2026-06-15

### Added

- **Radiology / imaging-led case-report track (G33–G35)** — a dedicated layer for radiology, nuclear-medicine, and interventional-radiology case reports, grounded in six CC-BY radiology case reports (Europe PMC, learn-only under `distill.py`; `_corpus/` gitignored, no source prose reproduced). Adds a `write-paper` **`exemplar_case_report_radiology.md`** (per-modality technique→findings→impression discipline; structured-reporting lexicons BI-RADS/LI-RADS/PI-RADS/TI-RADS/Lung-RADS/O-RADS with category meaning; quantitative anchors with ROI method and threshold honesty; multimodality discordance + modality-completeness; an interventional-radiology procedure/complication subtype; incidental-finding reporting; DICOM de-identification, real alt text, and device-vendor COI) wired into Phase 0 for imaging-led cases; extends the `/peer-review` + `/self-review` case-report probe to **CR1–CR9** (CR9 imaging-led discipline); and adds a compact `/find-journal` **BJR Case Reports** profile (`journal_profiles_find` 72→73). No new skill or reporting-guideline count.
- **Case-report depth batch (G27–G30)** — extends the case-report feature, grounded in six CC-BY case reports (fetched via Europe PMC, learn-only under the `distill.py` license firewall; `_corpus/` gitignored). Adds a `write-paper` **case-series** paper type (`references/paper_types/case_series.md`) + Phase 0 case-series mode — a methods-light mini-cohort (design/identification/eligibility/protocol + all-cases summary table + cross-case synthesis), not N stacked single reports, enforcing counts-not-rates and selection disclosure; enriches `exemplar_case_report.md` with **adverse-event/pharmacovigilance** (Naranjo/WHO-UMC causality, dechallenge, severity/preventability, denominator framing) and **diagnostic-pitfall/mimic** (differential adjudication, diagnostic-delay framing, self-critical mechanism reasoning) subtypes; extends the `/peer-review` + `/self-review` case-report probe to **CR1–CR8** (CR7 adverse-event causality discipline, CR8 case-series design); and adds a `/make-figures` **annotated multimodality imaging-panel** exemplar (`exemplar_plots/imaging_panel.md`) for discordance/response figures, distinct from the clinical-timeline chronology figure. Also adds four compact `/find-journal` **case-report venue profiles** (Journal of Medical Case Reports, Cureus, Radiology Case Reports, BMJ Case Reports; `journal_profiles_find` 68→72, identity/scope verified from primary CC-BY articles, submission limits flagged for pre-submission verification) and enriches `/check-reporting` `CARE.md` with adverse-event (causality instrument) and case-series (cohort-methods) application notes. No new skill or reporting-guideline count (36).
- **Reverse-engineering batch — adjacent clinical-research scaffolds (reporting guidelines 32 → 36).** A scored, gap-register-driven loop (`reverse_engineer/`) added guideline-grounded scaffolds for clinical-AI areas the project did not yet cover, each authored under the license firewall (`distill.py`): own-words **educational summaries** of the guideline item *intent* (no verbatim wording from copyrighted/NC sources), with `_corpus/` raw sources gitignored. Four new vendored reporting checklists in `skills/check-reporting/references/checklists/` — **TRIPOD-LLM** (studies using large language models; numbered to the official 19-item scheme), **CONSORT-AI** + **SPIRIT-AI** (AI clinical-trial reports + protocols; close a pre-existing `MISSING_CHECKLIST_CONTRACT_VIOLATION` where both were routed/aliased but unvendored), and **DECIDE-AI** (early-stage live clinical evaluation of AI decision-support). Each wired end-to-end (alias map, fail-fast test, `LICENSES.md` row, Step 1 auto-detect row, `skill.yml` card) and CI-gated by `validate_catalog_consistency.py` (32 → 36).
- **METRICS radiomics appraisal reference (`skills/check-reporting/references/appraisal_tools/METRICS.md`)** — a methodological-quality / risk-of-bias tool (EuSoMII; Kocak et al. *Insights Imaging* 2024, CC BY 4.0), 9 categories / 30 weighted condition-dependent items. Deliberately placed under `appraisal_tools/` (NOT counted `references/checklists/`) so it does **not** inflate the reporting-guideline count — the repo keeps appraisal tools distinct from reporting checklists (`critical_item_floor.md`). Wired as the load-on-demand reference behind the Step 4f appraisal cross-check; reporting-guideline count stays 36.
- **New domain-probe module + AI-extension subsections** (`skills/peer-review/references/domain-probes/`, vendored byte-identical into `/self-review`). New module **`diagnostic_accuracy.md` (D1–D6)** for DTA primary studies + multi-reader multi-case (MRMC) reader studies (verification/spectrum/blinding bias, indeterminate handling, fully-crossed/washout design, reader+case variance). Plus AI reporting-flow subsections on three existing modules: **TRIPOD+AI (T1–T4)** on `survival_prognostic.md`, **CONSORT-AI/SPIRIT-AI (A1–A5)** on `rct_trial.md`, and **decision-impact (DI1–DI5, DECIDE-AI axis)** on `ai_overclaiming.md`. `MODULES` tuple 7 → 8; routed from both peer-review (new Phase 2I) and self-review.
- **Figure-anatomy exemplars (`skills/make-figures/references/exemplar_plots/`)** — four new synthetic, citation-free anatomy models: **`decision_curve.md`** (net-benefit / DCA), **`mrmc_roc.md`** (MRMC reader-study ROC with per-reader + reader-averaged curves and reader+case CIs), **`bland_altman.md`** (agreement: bias + ±1.96·SD limits with CIs, proportional-bias check, not-a-correlation discipline), and **`confusion_matrix.md`** (raw + row/column-normalized, class-imbalance caveat).
- **Table-type standards (`skills/analyze-stats/references/table-standards/table-types/`)** — **`incremental_value.md`** (added value beyond a baseline: paired ΔAUC + DeLong CI, NRI event/non-event split, IDI, net benefit) and **`reader_study.md`** (MRMC per-reader + reader-averaged performance with Obuchowski–Rockette/DBM reader+case CIs, per-patient vs per-lesion unit).
- **Structured-abstract exemplar (`skills/write-paper/references/exemplar_abstract.md`)** — completes the write-paper exemplar set (intro/methods/results/discussion already shipped); mandates a primary estimate with 95% CI + denominator and a failure-modes section (no estimate-free "significant", no body↔abstract number mismatch). Wired into Phase 6.
- **Case-report writing feature (G24–G26)** — adds a clean-room `write-paper` case-report exemplar (`references/exemplar_case_report.md`) for CARE narrative flow and 150-word Introduction / Case Presentation / Conclusion abstracts; a new byte-vendored `/peer-review` + `/self-review` case-report domain probe (`domain-probes/case_report.md`, CR1–CR6) covering novelty/teaching value, consent and image de-identification, n=1 causal overclaiming, literature-boundary claims, CARE timeline/follow-up completeness, and teaching-point scope; and a `/make-figures` clinical-timeline anatomy model (`exemplar_plots/clinical_timeline.md`) for CARE timeline figures and annotated imaging-panel pairing. No new skill or reporting-guideline count.

### Changed

- **CARE version label aligned to the vendored checklist** — `/write-paper` case-report mode and paper-type template now refer to CARE 2013, matching `/check-reporting`'s bundled `CARE.md` (Gagnier et al. 2014 / care-statement.org), instead of the previous CARE 2016 label.
- **Recommendation-calibration gate (Phase 2F) extended to review articles + fixable/unfixable tier-domination** (`skills/peer-review/SKILL.md`). Phase 2F (previously "AI/Method Papers" only) now also fires for **Review / narrative / primer** articles and adds three rules: (1) **fixable vs unfixable tier-domination** — when repairable defects (extraction errors, missing supplementary, mislabeled table) coexist with unrepairable ones (poolability of incommensurable studies, broken construct, invalid evaluation instrument), the unfixable class governs the recommendation; (2) **review/narrative escalation** — for a review article the distinct contribution (novelty/synthesis/domain-specificity) *is* the product, so weak-novelty/no-distinct-contribution is **unfixable-in-current-form** ("add a contribution" = a different paper) and escalates one tier toward Reject rather than defaulting to the revision/Reconsider tier; (3) **confidential-note Reject-grade self-grep** — deferring the value/priority judgment to the editorial board is itself a Reject-grade tell, not a neutral hand-off. QC items 11/12 and the final checklist updated. Sourced from a review-article (LLM-hallucination primer) decision self-audit in which the reviewer recommended a Reconsider tier and the editor rejected — the 6th lenient-calibration recurrence; diagnosis remains calibration discipline, not a new type-probe.
- **Narrative-review RV4/RV5 sub-probes** (`skills/peer-review/references/domain-probes/narrative_review.md`, vendored byte-identical into `/self-review`). **RV4** gains a **model-class conflation** check for LLM/VLM-in-radiology reviews (text-only LLM language-support vs multimodal VLM image-interpretation vs conventional CAD treated as one risk profile; the actionable radiology contribution is usually a task-risk stratification, not a generic "LLMs hallucinate" statement). **RV5** gains a **source/cause vs masking/amplifying-factor** check (e.g., black-box opacity and automation bias listed as "sources" of hallucination when they hide or amplify rather than generate it — a sharper defect than "scattered taxonomy"). Both are in-niche conceptual catches missed in the source review but caught by other reviewers; bundled into existing RV4/RV5 (no new RV, no probe-count change).
- **Narrative-review probe expanded RV1–RV8 → RV1–RV9** (`skills/peer-review/references/domain-probes/narrative_review.md`, vendored byte-identical into `/self-review`). Adds **RV9 — Bibliometric circularity of a curated base**: a non-systematic review asserting a field-level/bibliometric asymmetry ("the field invested in X, neglected Y") is making a *measured* claim from an *unmeasured*, author-curated base; a hostile reviewer manufactures the reverse thesis by re-curating. RV9 names the two acceptable resolutions as a strategy fork — down-scope every claim site to "within the surveyed literature" (zero field-level residue) **or** add a documented search + per-axis counts — plus the engineering-density-vs-clinical-validation reframe. **RV6** gains the single-anchor-overload check (Abstract "landmark" ↔ body "base is thin" register mismatch); **RV8** gains the self-citation-architecture disclosure check (weakest axes coinciding with the authors' own forthcoming work). The `/self-review` narrative panel reviewer-set gains an **R4 Adversarial reject-hunter** seat (structural: RV9/RV6/RV8), with a matching focus checklist in `panel_review_template.md`. No skills/detector count change. Probe-count pointers across peer-review / self-review / review-paper SKILLs and the AJR reviewer profile updated to RV1–RV9.

## [4.1.0] - 2026-06-11

Theme: **distribution + a submission pre-flight gate.** Ships the borrow-distribution levers (Claude Code plugin marketplace, the named MedSci-Audit detector registry, and standalone hero-skill mirror tooling with two live mirror repos) and a single submission pre-flight halt-on-failure gate that bundles the existing detectors + `/verify-refs`. Analysis-integrity detectors **24 → 25** (still 43 skills). Frozen `demo/` and `evaluation/runs/canonical` artifacts (pinned to the published methods paper) are unchanged.

### Added

- **Claude Code plugin marketplace (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`)** — one-line install via `/plugin marketplace add Aperivue/medsci-skills`, then `/plugin` discovery of eight `medsci-*` category plugins (`medsci-literature`, `-data`, `-analysis`, `-writing`, `-review`, `-submission`, `-project`, `-presentation`) mirroring the storefront categories. Generated from `metadata/skills_catalog.json` by `scripts/gen_marketplace_json.py` (a pure downstream transform — the SSOT chain stays single-source) and CI-gated with `--check` plus `tests/test_marketplace_json.sh` (validated by `claude plugin validate`). The marketplace tracks `main`: no `version` is emitted, so each plugin's version is its git commit SHA. No skills change (still 43).
- **MedSci-Audit detector registry (`metadata/detectors_catalog.json` + `MEDSCI_AUDIT.md`)** — names and enumerates the 24 deterministic analysis-integrity detectors (previously only *counted* in `catalog_counts.json`) as a citable suite grouped into six audit families. Generated by `scripts/gen_detectors_catalog_json.py` using the same `skills/*/scripts/` glob as `validate_catalog_consistency.py`, so `detector_count` always equals `catalog_counts.json::integrity_detectors` (24); CI-gated with `--check` + `tests/test_detectors_catalog_json.sh`. `MEDSCI_AUDIT.md` documents the suite, the anti-hallucination vs mechanical-fix split, and keeps the current catalog (24) distinct from the v3.8-era canonical evaluation evidence (E1: 19 specs / 17 injectors; E7: n=21). No skills change (still 43).
- **Hero-skill standalone mirrors (`metadata/hero_skills.json` + `scripts/sync_hero_skill.py`)** — distribution lever: mirror a focused single skill out to its own repo as a star funnel that backlinks to the full suite. `sync_hero_skill.py` builds a complete standalone tree (skill copied verbatim + generated README/LICENSE/CITATION.cff/`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`/installer/minimal CI; author metadata read at runtime from the canonical `CITATION.cff`) and force-pushes it; `.github/workflows/mirror-hero-skills.yml` auto-syncs on `main` changes (no-ops without the `HERO_SKILL_TOKEN` secret). First hero: **`verify-refs`** → [`Aperivue/verify-refs`](https://github.com/Aperivue/verify-refs). The canonical `verify-refs` SKILL.md companion note was made tool-agnostic so it mirrors verbatim. CI-gated with `tests/test_sync_hero_skill.sh`. No skills change (still 43).
- **Second hero skill: `check-reporting`** → [`Aperivue/check-reporting`](https://github.com/Aperivue/check-reporting) — audit a manuscript against 32 EQUATOR reporting guidelines. Added as one `hero_skills.json` entry (no new tooling). The skill's `references/LICENSES.md` third-party carve-out (CC BY-NC for CARE / MI-CLEAR-LLM, RSNA for CLAIM) is carried into the standalone `LICENSE` by the sync script. `tests/test_sync_hero_skill.sh` now builds and verifies every hero skill (28 checks). No skills change (still 43).
- **Placeholder/marker detector (`skills/write-paper/scripts/check_placeholders.py`)** — promotes the previously grep-in-prose pre-submission marker check (write-paper Phase 0/7, self-review Phase 2.5c) to a deterministic, CI-tested gate. Flags unresolved `[@NEW:topic]` citation placeholders, AI-disclosure `[version]/[date]/[tool]/[model]/[channel]` tokens, `TODO`/`FIXME`/`TBD`/`XXX` markers, and template/empty URLs (`example.com`, `doi.org/XXXX`, empty `]( )`, `[URL]`) as **blockers**; bare `[N]`/`[N–N]` numeric citations as **warn** (legitimate in Vancouver style — escalated with `--strict`). Guards skip fenced code blocks and the References section. Stdlib-only; exit 1 on any blocker. Registered in the MedSci-Audit catalog under *citation & reference integrity*, bringing the analysis-integrity detector count **24 → 25**; CI-gated by `gen_detectors_catalog_json.py --check` + `skills/write-paper/tests/test_placeholders.sh` (A5). No skills change (still 43).
- **Submission pre-flight gate (`skills/sync-submission/scripts/preflight_gate.py`)** — the single last-step-before-freeze halt check. Orchestrates the existing detectors + `/verify-refs` into one command that writes an aggregated manifest (`qc/preflight_gate_report.json`) and **exits non-zero on any blocker** so a build/CI wrapper halts the freeze. Composes the per-check scripts via subprocess (reimplements none); the halt decision is driven by each sub-check's normalized exit code, not by parsing its JSON. By default it halts only on the unambiguous deterministic errors (**P0**: leftover placeholders, undefined `[@key]` citations, duplicate references, canonical-vs-submission hash drift); the heuristic/conditional checks (`check_xref`, `detect_copy_divergence`, `scope_drift_check`, `cover_letter_drift_check`, `cross_document_n_check`, `check_cross_artifact_stale`) run and report as **P1 warn** unless promoted with `--strict`/`--require`, and `check_asset_anonymization` under `--double-blind`. Absent inputs are `skipped`, never blockers (tolerant of projects with no docx/cover letter/copies). Normalizes the inverted `cover_letter_drift_check.py` exit code. The offline references pass is the deterministic subset (duplicates + pagination placeholders); an online `/verify-refs --strict` remains the authoritative fabrication/author check. CI-gated by `skills/sync-submission/tests/test_preflight_gate.sh` (A6). Not a detector (no catalog change); no skills change (still 43).

## [4.0.0] - 2026-06-10

Theme: extend the project's own deterministic, no-drift SSOT discipline to the public storefront, finish the detector backlog, and roll up the English-canonical i18n migration. Analysis-integrity detectors **21 → 24** (still 43 skills). Frozen `demo/` and `evaluation/runs/canonical` artifacts (pinned to the published methods paper) are unchanged.

### Added

- **Storefront catalog SSOT (`metadata/skills_catalog.json`)** — a generated, machine-readable catalog (slug + research-lifecycle category + one-line description for all 43 skills, derived from each `SKILL.md` + `skill.yml` `owner_domain`) via `scripts/gen_skills_catalog_json.py`, CI-gated with `--check`. The aperivue.com storefront vendors this file behind an offline sync gate so the public site can never silently drift behind the repo (it had shown 40 skills while the repo shipped 43).
- **Asset/figure anonymization gate** — `skills/sync-submission/scripts/check_asset_anonymization.py` scans figure-generating scripts, figure-PDF rendered text, and docx/PDF metadata authors (`dc:creator`, `/Author`) for the institution/author leaks a body-text scan misses. Generic English+Korean institution patterns + a local-only `--names-file`; degrades gracefully when poppler is absent.
- **Cross-artifact staleness gate** — `check_cross_artifact_stale.py` flags supplement values that disagree with the corrected body (reconciliation-prone labels) and reporting checklists built against an older manuscript version. `/check-reporting` now emits a `target_manuscript` / `target_version` / `source_sha256` contract (report `check_reporting_version` 1.1) verified by `check_checklist_version.py`.
- **Survival reporting hardening** — `/analyze-stats`'s survival template now reports median survival with its 95% CI, a Cox events-per-variable gate, and cluster-robust (cluster-sandwich) SE for nested observation units (`--cluster`); the cluster-robust rule extends to logistic/linear regression.
- **Language Policy + locale-inventory gate** — MedSci Skills is now explicitly English-canonical: skill mechanics and prose are English, and non-English (currently Korean) text is allowed only as a labeled locale feature, a locale-jurisdiction mode (e.g. `grant-builder`'s Korean Government Grant Mode), a bilingual `triggers:` alias, or an opt-in `*_ko` variant. A new [`docs/locale_inventory.md`](docs/locale_inventory.md) lists every Korean-bearing file under `skills/` with a one-line justification, and a new stdlib detector `scripts/check_locale_inventory.py` (wired into CI + `tests/test_locale_inventory.sh`) fails if any Korean-bearing file is missing from that inventory — the authoritative allowlist, complementing the WARN-only Korean-prose check in `validate_skills.sh`. CONTRIBUTING gains a Language Policy section + PR-checklist item. This is the policy/scaffold step (PR1); incidental-prose translation (PR2) and English-default-with-Korean-opt-in redesign (PR3) follow. Catalog unchanged at 43 skills.

### Changed

- **English-canonical translation of incidental skill prose (PR2)** — translated leftover Korean *prose* to English across 12 files with zero functional loss: `humanize/references/ai_patterns.md` (Patterns 19–21), the four `meta-analysis/references/*.md` (data-integrity / release-ops / review-orchestration / package-drift), `meta-analysis/SKILL.md`, `ma-scout/SKILL.md` (internal tables), `author-strategy/SKILL.md` (example query), `define-variables/{references/common_definitions.md, templates/variable_operationalization.md}`, `check-reporting/references/step4d_prisma_figure_audit.md`, `write-paper/references/section_guides/step7_1_classical_qc.md`, `orchestrate/references/dialogue_nodes.md`, and `peer-review/references/reviewer_profiles/RYAI.md`. Functional/locale Korean is preserved and inventory-tracked (KNHANES labels, Korean PHI pack, Korean-form-matching demo in `fill-protocol/references/best_practices.md`, bilingual triggers). The `validate_skills.sh` Korean-prose check now passes for every skill except one inventory-justified locale example. No behavior change; catalog unchanged at 43 skills. (PR3 = English-default + Korean-opt-in redesign follows.)
- **English-default skills with opt-in Korean (PR3)** — the skills that previously *defaulted* to Korean output/interaction now default to English, with Korean preserved as an opt-in `*_ko` variant or via a "communicate in the user's preferred language" instruction. User-facing prompts are English by default (`write-paper` Discussion-planning Q1–Q5 + review prompt, `analyze-stats` / `make-figures` / `orchestrate` PHI prompts, `fill-icmje-coi` co-author email). `present-paper` speaker-notes default to the user's language (Korean register still supported; pronunciation dict + legacy Korean slide-marker parser kept). `lit-sync` defaults to English vault folders (`Literature/`, `Concepts/`) and English note headings but **honors an existing Korean vault layout** (never renames a user's folders); the Korean layout + templates move to `references/locale/ko/note_templates.md`. `render-pdf-doc` body/skill.yml are English and each `templates/*.md` starter gains a `*_ko.md` Korean sibling; `orchestrate/references/report_template.md` and `ma-scout/references/project_readme_template.md` become English defaults with `*_ko.md` variants. The locale inventory is reconciled (50 Korean-bearing files, all justified; `check_locale_inventory.py --strict` clean). No catalog change (43 skills); the 7 new `*_ko`/locale files are opt-in variants, not new skills.
- **Locale labels + finalize (PR4)** — added explicit "Locale: Korean" header notes to the whole-file Korean locale references (`render-pdf-doc/references/{pandoc_korean_cheatsheet,known_pitfalls}.md`, `deidentify/references/korean_phi_patterns.md`) so an internal reader sees the intent immediately, and marked `docs/locale_inventory.md` as migration-complete (steady state). The English-canonical migration is now complete: every remaining Korean string is a justified locale feature, a Korean-jurisdiction mode (`grant-builder`'s Korean Government Grant Mode), a bilingual trigger, or an opt-in `*_ko` variant. Validator #9 stays WARN-only by design; `check_locale_inventory.py` is the authoritative allowlist gate.

## [3.8.0] - 2026-06-07

An `evaluation/` harness suite that validates the instrument itself, plus a reconcile of the README Live-Demos numbers with the v3.7.0 clean-room demo artifacts. Catalog unchanged at 43 skills, 21 detectors — this release adds tooling and tracked evidence, not skills.

### Added

- **Evaluation harness suite (`evaluation/`)** — stdlib-only harnesses that validate the tool (not manuscript quality): **E1** seeded-defect detector benchmark (one defect injected per temp copy, recall + clean false-positive rate; offline-deterministic with a `--check` reproducibility-hash gate; network-required citation defects marked NOT_RUN unless `--online`), **E4** fresh-clone manifest reproducibility (`--ref` RC-SHA pre-tag / `v3.8.0` tag post-tag), **E5** claim audit-trail completeness (deterministic provenance pre-fill: manuscript → analysis table → manifest → QC), **E6** host-portability smoke (installer `--self-test` + path-contract scan + host-target mapping), **E7** detector coverage inventory, **E8** catalog claim-drift resistance (temp-copy only), and **E3** cost/time. Each run writes a self-describing log package (`run_manifest.json` with per-component determinism class + input/output hashes, `commands.sh`, `environment.txt`, `git_commit.txt`, `metrics.csv`, `limitations.md`). A committed canonical run lives under `evaluation/runs/canonical/`. The LLM comparator (**E2**) and a self-review convergence harness (**E9**) ship runnable with MI-CLEAR-LLM-inspired logging but are NOT executed in this release (graceful NOT_RUN without an API key / runner). All harnesses operate on temp copies and never mutate the real `demo/` tree or repo.

### Changed

- **README Live-Demos reconcile** — demo numbers re-derived from the v3.7.0 QC artifacts (STARD 60.9% (14/23), PRISMA 57.1% (24/42), STROBE 83.3% (25/30); Demo 3 analytic N 5,010; Demo 3 adjusted OR 3.03 (2.29–4.02); self-review verdicts from `qc/self_review.md`); figure links relinked to actual paths (`forest.png`, `forest_or.png`, `figures/stard_flow.svg`); unproduced slide/cover-letter/bubble-plot entries removed. Provenance for every number is logged in `evaluation/_readme_reconcile_sources.md`.

## [3.7.0] - 2026-06-07

Three new deterministic, stdlib-only detectors extend the v3.6.0 panel-derived gates — reference *adequacy*, panel lens-diversity, and generated-code quality — bringing the analysis-integrity detector count in `skills/` to 21. A publish-time skill-worthiness gate and public adoption/impact tracking round out the release. Catalog unchanged at 43 skills; every addition is a check, probe, or convention inside an existing skill.

### Added

- **Reference adequacy gates (`/self-review` Phase 2.5c-2, `/write-paper` Step 7.3c, `/search-lit`)** — a new stdlib detector `scripts/check_reference_adequacy.py` adds a reference *adequacy* layer (enough refs, the right sections, every named method cited), complementing the existing reference *integrity* gate (`/verify-refs`). The dominant failure mode in an autonomous draft is a Statistical Analysis subsection that names a competing-risk model, multiple imputation, the E-value, and an eGFR equation with zero citations — internally consistent prose no integrity check flags. The checker carries an article-type alias map + count targets, a two-tier named-method registry (STATISTICAL → Major / GUIDELINE → Minor), and paragraph-level citation clustering; `/self-review` Phase 2.5c-2 folds findings into `issues[]` (category F). `/write-paper` Step 7.3c invokes the same checker via the `${MEDSCI_SKILLS_ROOT}` cross-skill pattern and loops `/search-lit → /lit-sync → /verify-refs`; `/search-lit` gains a "Manuscript Paper Reference Pool" mode (25–40 candidates across six categories, appended to `references/library.bib` only). Every finding is `fixable_by_ai:false` (diagnose only). PII-free fixtures + regression test (#88).
- **Adoption & impact tracking** — a public [`IMPACT.md`](IMPACT.md) dashboard, an automated weekly metrics snapshot (`.github/workflows/metrics.yml` → `metrics/traffic_log.csv`, capturing stars/forks/release-downloads/14-day traffic/Zenodo stats that GitHub otherwise discards after 14 days), a [`docs/citations.md`](docs/citations.md) ledger for academic citations and named downstream use, and a "Used in research" issue template (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/used-in-research.yml`) for collecting user reports. No skill behavior changes; catalog unchanged at 43 skills.
- **Skill-worthiness gate (`/publish-skill` Phase 0.5)** — before the PII scrub, a three-way gate (Uniqueness: not reconstructable by a 5-minute web search; Specificity: encodes a domain/workflow heuristic, not a generic snippet; Effort: took real debugging, design, or reviewer-anticipation effort) decides whether a workflow merits distribution as a skill at all. A failing workflow is routed to documentation or a memory note rather than diluting the catalog — the publish-time analogue of the "reusable pattern vs one-off hack" distinction. Prose-only.
- **Panel lens-diversity gate (`/self-review` Phase 2.6, `--panel`)** — a new stdlib detector `scripts/check_panel_diversity.py` post-processes the panel's reviewer outputs so its cost buys breadth, not a louder echo of one theme: `UNCOVERED_AXIS` (an axis the research type is expected to probe drew zero major findings — re-probe before finalizing), `FAMILY_MONOCULTURE` (the majors concentrate in one concern family), and `LENS_COLLAPSE` (a fully-redundant reviewer adding no independent axis). Healthy CONSENSUS is preserved — the checks fire on panel-level coverage and full redundancy, never on agreement. A new Step 3.5 wires it into the editor synthesis, and `panel_review_template.md` documents the expected-axis manifest. PII-free fixtures + regression test.
- **Generated-code quality gate (`/analyze-stats` Phase 3.5; pointers in `/batch-cohort` rule 10 and `/make-figures`)** — a new stdlib detector `scripts/check_generated_code.py` lints emitted `.py`/`.R` analysis scripts for the reproducibility/integrity slop AI-generated code recurrently carries: `MISSING_SEED`, `HARDCODED_DATA_LITERAL` (hand-typed tabular data instead of read_csv + subset — the data-integrity rule), `HARDCODED_ABS_PATH`, and `INPLACE_SOURCE_OVERWRITE` (writing to the source path) as Major, plus `DEBUG_LEFTOVER` and `UNUSED_IMPORT` flags. Conservative on the Major checks (Python uses AST for unused-import detection). Dogfooding it over the shipped analysis templates surfaced and removed ten genuinely dead imports. PII-free fixtures + regression test. Catalog unchanged at 43 skills.

## [3.6.0] - 2026-06-06

A 13-project panel self-review distilled 158 cross-project traces into 12 recurring defect patterns; this release lands the 18 resulting gates (P1/P2/P3) as deterministic, stdlib-only checks wherever a grep is clean, and as prose/probe guidance where the call needs a human. Six new detectors join the existing trio, each with PII-free synthetic fixtures and a regression test. Catalog unchanged at 43 skills — every addition is a check, probe, or convention inside an existing skill.

### Added

- **Cohort arithmetic gate (`/self-review` Phase 2.5 / 2.5b)** — a new stdlib detector `scripts/check_cohort_arithmetic.py` recomputes the numbers a reviewer checks by hand: `RATE_BACKCALC` (an incidence rate must invert to its own events ÷ person-years), `CASCADE_SUM` (a STROBE exclusion cascade must balance — start − Σexclusions == final; total − missing == complete), and `PARTITION_OVERLAP` (an ordinal tier/stratum split claimed disjoint must satisfy Σn == unique total and Σevents == total events; all-equal-n is a stratum-total mis-entry). Parses prose equations + GFM tables, recomputes from a committed CSV when given one. Phase 2.5b's screening-count reconciliation is extended from SR/MA to observational tier/stratum partitions.
- **Methods ↔ Results ↔ disk artifact coverage (`/self-review` Phase 2.5f, `/write-paper` Step 7.3b)** — a new detector `scripts/check_artifact_coverage.py` reconciles both directions: `PROMISED_ABSENT` (an analysis named in Methods that never reaches Results) and `DISK_UNREPORTED` (an analysis output on disk — an added-value DeLong CSV, a calibration table — never mentioned in the body, the run-but-unreported result that may undercut the headline). The reverse direction is calibrated against false positives via an `_analysis_outputs.md` manifest (source of truth when present) and analysis-bearing file-stem escalation otherwise.
- **Endpoint ↔ conclusion scope gate (`/self-review` §D, `/design-study`, `/write-paper`)** — a new detector `scripts/check_scope_coherence.py` flags `CROSS_SECTIONAL_PROGNOSTIC` (a cross-sectional/single-visit design with a prognostic or surveillance conclusion) and `SURROGATE_CARE_DIRECTIVE` (a binary surrogate endpoint driving a defer/withhold/initiate-therapy directive). Fires only when a design/endpoint signal and a conclusion-region action verb co-occur.
- **Reporting-framework naming audit (`/check-reporting` Step 4e)** — a new detector `scripts/check_framework_naming.py` flags `BASE_MISSING` (an AI extension — PROBAST+AI, STARD-AI, TRIPOD+AI, PRISMA-DTA — invoked without naming/citing its base instrument), plus `HYPHEN_MIX`, `CITE_MISSING`, `SELF_COINED_LABEL`, and `VAGUE_GUIDANCE` ("adapted per recent guidance"). `/write-paper` Step 7.1 adds an AI-disclosure meta-applicability gate (a disclosure paragraph must itself carry version + access channel + date range + responsible party, with zero placeholders).
- **Classical-style body lint (`/self-review` §J, `/write-paper` Step 7.1)** — a new detector `scripts/check_classical_style.py` flags `SECTION_SYMBOL` (any § in the body) and `INBODY_AI_DISCLOSURE` (an AI-disclosure paragraph that belongs on the title page) as Major, and `ELIGIBILITY_PROSE`, `DECIMAL_INCONSISTENCY` (mixed OR/HR decimal places), `EM_DASH_OVERUSE` as Minor — the machine-checkable subset of the classical-QC checklist.
- **Reviewer-team 3-way (`/self-review` §K)** — `scripts/check_reviewer_team_consistency.py` extends beyond the dual-claim/single-confession conjunction to the prose ↔ JSON ↔ confession 3-way: an LLM named in an extraction JSON's reviewer field (`--extraction-json`) is fatal (a tool is not a reviewer), and a future-tense deferred mitigation ("will be completed before submission") is a Major. The existing contract is preserved.
- **Estimand & CI output contract (`/analyze-stats`)** — quantile estimands (T25, median time-to-event), pooled proportions, and subdistribution HRs must emit a 95% CI, not a bare point estimate; a Cox events-per-variable ≥ 10 gate (Firth/penalized fallback); single-arm proportion meta-analysis bans Egger's (Peters'/arcsine, k ≥ 10) and standardizes τ² + a 95% prediction interval; naive Wilson CIs on study-nested proportions are flagged; Fine-Gray requires a subdistribution-PH check. Interaction/synergy questions must anchor the estimand to the interaction parameter, and equivalence claims must declare a margin (TOST/MCID).
- **Stratified & survival reporting (`/analyze-stats`)** — a strata-disjointness gate before any Cochran-Armitage trend test; a secondary stratum-HR checklist (referent + per-stratum events + sparse caveat); a proportion-CI lower-bound clamp to max(0, ·); an interval-censoring auto-trigger for visit-dated events; a PH-violation rule (piecewise/time-stratified HR, never a single time-averaged HR); and a number-at-risk requirement when a KM/CIF is quoted past median follow-up.
- **Meta-analysis pool & method guards (`/meta-analysis`)** — the FINAL_POOL_LOCK now also locks patient/lesion aggregate totals (arm-separable vs both-arm), a "fixed"/"resolved" audit note requires re-run evidence, the k=1-subgroup lesson extends to k < 4, a PROSPERO ID format gate (`^CRD42\d{9}$`, 14 chars) lands in both `/meta-analysis` Phase 1 and `/check-reporting` Step 4c, plus new lessons on outcome harmonization (do not pool different outcome definitions into one range) and heterogeneous-RoB κ (per-instrument agreement, never one pooled κ), and a flag → form-edit forced transition in Phase 4c.
- **Leakage, time-origin & construct concordance (`/design-study`, survival probe)** — Phase 2 gains a time-origin & survivorship subsection (immortal time, left-truncation, mediator-ascertainment-window survivorship, complete-case primary-set selection) and the survival domain-probe S1 escalates a "not formally assessed" self-confession to Major; Phase 2C adds construct ↔ nominal-definition match, per-flag reference-standard concordance, and a manuscript-definition ↔ `variable_operationalization.md` cross-check.
- **Reference placeholder gate (`/verify-refs` Gate 6, `/self-review` Phase 2.5c, `/write-paper` Phase 0)** — `verify_refs.py` flags pagination/publication-stage placeholders (`e000–e000`, `in press`, `TBD`, `forthcoming`) as `UNVERIFIED + note="pagination_placeholder"` while staying manuscript-agnostic; the centrality call (a method/headline-load-bearing cite → P0) is made by `/self-review` Phase 2.5c, and `/write-paper` Phase 0 blocks bare `[N]`/`[N–N]` citation placeholders alongside `[@NEW:]`.

## [3.5.0] - 2026-06-06

Analysis-integrity guards across the manuscript pipeline — backporting the findings a multi-agent panel review caught into deterministic, stdlib-only single-pass checks, and pushing them upstream into the source, writing, figure, and submission stages. Catalog unchanged at 43 skills; the new probes are checks and reference files inside existing skills.

### Added

- **`/self-review` category C — power-aware null interpretation**: a new check that scores non-significant primary results (p > 0.05, 95% CI crossing the null) for whether the analysis is powered to *exclude* a clinically meaningful effect. An underpowered null is flagged as "not yet established" rather than "no effect," and the check watches for bilateral over-correction (a prior overclaim swinging to an equally unsupported negative claim during revision). Undocumented null = Minor; a null driving a clinical recommendation without power/CI-compatibility justification = Major. Backports a panel-only finding into the single-pass review (prose check, no new dependency).
- **`/self-review` Phase 2.5e — confounding completeness (observational)** + a new **`observational_confounding.md` domain-probe module (O1–O6)**: a deterministic gate (`scripts/check_confounding_completeness.py`, stdlib-only) joins the exposure-stratified Table 1 against the Methods adjustment set and flags every covariate that is measured, imbalanced by exposure (p < 0.05 or SMD > 0.1), yet absent from the adjustment set as an `UNADJUSTED_IMBALANCED` Major candidate, with an extended-adjustment sensitivity fix. The O1–O6 probe module (confounding completeness, adjustment-set provenance, selection/collider bias, exposure measurement validity, missing-data / complete-case collapse, residual-confounding E-value) closes the gap where observational studies had no domain-probe set; it is vendored byte-identical into `/peer-review` (canonical, new Phase 2E) and `/self-review`, and added to the `check_domain_probe_sync.py` drift gate (now 5 modules). `/design-study` gains a matching DAG-first adjustment-set planning note. Backports the panel's highest-yield observational finding into the single-pass review.
- **Structural-zero / dose-duration covariate guards (`/analyze-stats`, `/clean-data`, `/define-variables`)**: a coupled source-side defense against the most common observational miscoding — a dose/duration variable anchored to a categorical exposure (pack-years under smoking status, grams/week under alcohol use). `/clean-data` gains a Stage-2 flag for *categorical-implied zeros* (a `never` record with a NULL dose is a contradiction, not missing data) plus a stdlib detector `scripts/check_structural_zero.py`; `/analyze-stats` gains a "Covariate Pitfalls" section warning against imputing structural zeros (MICE fabricates a non-zero dose for the unexposed) and against complete-case collapse (the unexposed stratum is silently dropped, shrinking n 40–60%), recommending adjustment on the categorical status with the continuous dose reserved for an exposed-only secondary analysis; `/define-variables` gains a matching failure mode requiring `IF status == 'never' THEN dose = 0` to be operationalized explicitly. Synthetic PII-free fixtures + regression test included.
- **`/self-review` Phase 2.5f — claim-vs-artifact cross-check** + survival probe **S8 (estimand provenance)**: a deterministic gate (`scripts/check_claim_artifact.py`, stdlib-only) checks claims against the artifacts they should trace to — it flags `PRIMARY_REASSIGNED` / `ESTIMAND_DRIFT` when the manuscript's primary contrast was re-designated after results were known or does not match the pre-registration, and `EVALUE_ARITHMETIC` / `EVALUE_NON_PRIMARY` when a reported E-value does not recompute from its primary estimate or is borrowed from a secondary one. A primary-change guard accompanies it. The survival/prognostic domain-probe module gains **S8 (estimand provenance)** and an **S2** note on structural-zero covariates collapsing the complete-case Cox sample (both vendored byte-identical into `/peer-review` canonical Phase 2B and `/self-review`; module now S1–S8). Figure/flow-count, Methods-promised-analysis, and imputation-input subchecks are reserved in the JSON schema for follow-up. Backports the panel's estimand-provenance findings into the single-pass review.
- **`/write-paper` Step 7.3b — estimand provenance & promised-analysis audit** + Abstract estimand-shopping guardrail: a new Phase-7 step delegates the claim-vs-artifact cross-check to `/self-review` Phase 2.5f (P0 blocker → Audit Recovery on `PRIMARY_REASSIGNED` / `ESTIMAND_DRIFT` / `EVALUE_ARITHMETIC`) and adds an inline Methods→Results promised-analysis grep (a promised-but-absent analysis HALTs the pipeline). Phase 6 (Abstract) gains a guardrail to lead with the *pre-specified primary estimand* rather than the largest effect — tightening effect-size language is fine, but promoting a secondary/exploratory/post-hoc estimate to the headline is estimand shopping. Prevents the estimand-provenance failure at write time.
- **`/make-figures` — Figure 1 caption ↔ flow-SSOT reconciliation**: a new stdlib detector `scripts/derive_figure_legend_counts.py` re-derives participant counts from the flow-diagram config (the SSOT consumed by `generate_flow_diagram.R`) and flags any `n = N` in the Figure 1 caption that is not a box count in the diagram (the classic "caption says n = 1,284 analytic, box says n = 998" defect that surfaces only at submission). Parses the config as text, so it is flow-tool-agnostic; pairs with numerical-safety's re-derive-every-revision rule. Synthetic fixtures + regression test included.
- **`/sync-submission` Phase 8 + Gate 11 — multi-copy manuscript divergence**: a new stdlib detector `scripts/detect_copy_divergence.py` compares a designated SSOT manuscript against each hand-maintained copy (circulation, portal) and reports the SSOT numeric claims (`n = N`, percentages, `p`, OR/HR/RR, 95% CI) and headings that did not propagate — the "14 edits applied to the SSOT, only 8 reached the portal copy" failure. A `STALE_COPY` is a P0 blocker; the recommended fix is to generate the variants from the single SSOT via a build step rather than hand-maintain parallel copies. Claims match as normalized strings (wording differences do not register). Synthetic fixtures + regression test included.
- **Incremental-value probe (`/design-study`, `/write-paper`)**: when a study frames a model/marker as adding value *beyond* an existing tool, `/design-study` Phase 3 now requires pre-specifying the in-routine-use baseline comparator plus an incremental metric (ΔC-index/ΔAUC with a paired CI, NRI, IDI, or decision-curve net benefit), and `/write-paper` Results requires the nested-model comparison to be reported — a standalone discrimination number does not support a "beyond X" claim, and the gap cannot be filled post hoc without the baseline model. Prose-only.

## [3.4.0] - 2026-06-06

Dual-review consolidation and a multi-agent panel mode for self-review — depth without broadening the catalog (still 43 skills).

### Added

- **`/self-review --panel`**: an opt-in multi-agent panel mode — several domain-expert reviewers run independently (blinded), then an editor consolidates their findings with CONSENSUS (≥2-reviewer) flags and R1/R2/R3 attribution, for a high-stakes pre-submission final pass. The default single-pass review stays the fast path. Portable across hosts: parallel subagents where the host provides them, with an explicit sequential blinded fallback and no `Workflow`-tool dependency. Output maps onto the existing Fatal/Fixable framing and R0 numbering, so `/revise` still consumes it; ships a PII-scrubbed `panel_review_template.md` and a structural + leak test (PR #73).
- **Shared domain-probe modules**: the SR-MA (P0–P10), survival/prognostic (S1–S7), radiomics (R1–R4), and narrative-review (RV1–RV8) critique probes are now reusable modules under `references/domain-probes/`, vendored byte-identical into both `/peer-review` (canonical) and `/self-review`. This closes the gap where `/self-review` had no survival / time-to-event probe set. A new `scripts/check_domain_probe_sync.py` drift gate (sha256 byte-identity) is wired into CI and `validate_skills.sh` (PR #72).
- **`/orchestrate`**: routes harsh / top-tier / multi-reviewer requests to `/self-review --panel`; the panel is opt-in and never auto-applied in chains or `--e2e` (PR #73).

### Changed

- **`/peer-review` Phase 2A–2D** now point to the shared domain-probe modules instead of carrying the probe bodies inline; the Major / Minor + Confidential-to-editor routing is applied at the pointer, so review behavior is unchanged. `references/reviewer_profiles/`, the Aczel tone audit, and `narrative_review_audit.md` remain peer-review-only (PR #72).

Catalog unchanged at 43 skills — the panel is a mode of an existing skill, and the probes are reference files inside existing skills.

## [3.3.0] - 2026-06-03

Packaging, portability, and trust signals — sharpening the "submission-grade clinical manuscript workflow" wedge without broadening scope.

### Added

- **Per-skill Quality Cards**: every skill now ships a `skill.yml` (42/42) with an optional, additive **v2.1 quality-card** extension — `purpose`, `safety_boundaries`, `known_limitations`, `validation_commands`, and a strict `evidence_surface` label (`ci_validator` / `demo` / `bundled_script` / `manual_workflow` / `not_yet_demonstrated`). `scripts/gen_skill_docs.py` renders the card into each `docs/skills/` page and tags the index with each skill's evidence level. Labels are grounded in repo reality, not asserted (PR #57, #58, #59).
- **`docs/skills/AUDIT.md`**: the validation story grounded in the actual CI gates and the three manifest-locked demos, with explicit trust boundaries — what is automated, what is reviewed by hand, and what is deliberately not claimed (PR #59).
- **`docs/host_compatibility.md`**: a verified host-compatibility matrix (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot). Each VERIFIED cell carries a source URL and retrieval date; OpenClaw/Hermes are marked UNVERIFIED-roadmap. Confirms Codex reads `~/.agents/skills` and that Cursor + GitHub Copilot read the same directories as Claude Code, so the existing two install targets already cover four hosts (PR #60).
- **`docs/competitive_positioning.md`**: a neutral comparison to broad skill catalogs, with caveated, dated skill counts (PR #54).
- **`installers/install.py --self-test`**: simulates Claude/Codex/Cursor installs into temporary directories, asserts every skill is discoverable, and proves no real host directory is touched; real installs now run a post-copy discoverability check (PR #56).

### Changed

- **README positioning sharpened**: adds the canonical lines (a submission-grade clinical manuscript workflow; competes on clinical submission reliability, not skill count), removes volatile competitor skill counts from the body, and softens the citation claim to validator-backed language (reference-verification gates + citation-audit workflows) (PR #54).
- **`skill.yml` contract now required**: with all 42 skills shipping a contract, a missing `skill.yml` is a CI failure rather than a migration warning — closing the v1→v2 migration (PR #57, #58).

### Fixed

- CITATION.cff EQUATOR-guideline count corrected from 33 to 32 (matches the catalog count SSOT).

## [3.2.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- **`/version-dataset`** (new skill, brings the catalog to 42): dataset version control — a deterministic content-hash manifest (file SHA-256 + tabular schema + per-column value hashes), `verify` to detect drift (schema / row-count / value changes), and `diff` between versions. Each bundled `demo/*/` now carries a `manifest.lock.json` (input data + deterministic result tables) verified in CI — closing codex Improvement E (demo reproducibility).
- **`/generate-codebook`** (new skill, brings the catalog to 41): generates a citable data dictionary / codebook (`codebook.md` + `codebook.json`) from a tabular dataset, profiling variable role / type / level frequencies / range / missingness. Coded variables whose level meanings are unknown are flagged `[NEEDS DICTIONARY]` rather than guessed — the generator side of the dictionary-first workflow; feeds `/define-variables`.
- `/calc-sample-size`: observational-cohort precision-branch reference for retrospective / fixed-extract studies (PR #40).
- `/verify-refs`: **v1.3.0** full-author cross-check via PubMed `efetch` — co-author hallucinations at positions #2..#N are now caught, not just the first author; `schema_version` → 4 (PR #41).
- `/check-reporting`: fail-fast guard (`scripts/check_checklist_exists.py`) — a routed guideline with no vendored checklist now halts with `MISSING_CHECKLIST_CONTRACT_VIOLATION` instead of silently constructing items from model memory; from-memory requires explicit `--allow-from-memory` (PR #42).
- `/check-reporting`: vendored four previously-gitignored checklists — **CONSORT 2025, SPIRIT 2025, CARE 2013, CLAIM 2024** — with per-file license attribution and a "Third-party licenses" note (PR #43, #45).
- `scripts/validate_routing_assets.py`: CI gate that every `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` asset reference and check-reporting checklist bullet resolves to a real file (PR #43).
- `metadata/catalog_counts.json` + `scripts/validate_catalog_consistency.py`: single source of truth for skill / guideline / journal-profile counts, wired into CI — public-doc counts that drift from disk now fail the build. The check now also gates the README shields **badge** (`Skills-N`) and matches guideline-count claims case-insensitively, so a drifted badge or section heading fails CI (PR #50).
- **`/revise`**: R1 vs R2+ cover-letter protocol — on a second-or-later revision the editor cover letter folds into the response-letter "head" rather than a separate document; adds a "Succinctness & non-defensiveness (R2+)" voice section, a synthetic before/after gallery, and matching verification gates. `/humanize` cross-references it as a triage cue (PR #51).
- **Contributor funnel**: GitHub issue forms (skill request / bug report / docs improvement), a pull-request template, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant 2.1 by reference), and `docs/seed_issues.md` (PR #50).

### Changed

- **Reporting-guideline count corrected from 33 to 32** across README, `/orchestrate`, `/check-reporting`, and the make-figures guideline map — the enumeration and vendored checklist files were both 32; "33" was an off-by-one now backed by the count SSOT.
- **README restructured for faster onboarding** — a Quick Start (install + first command) above the demos, the three heavy demo output tables collapsed behind `<details>`, and "What's New" refreshed and moved below the demos (PR #50).
- Skill badge corrected from 40 to 42 (PR #50).

### Fixed

- **DOI badge now renders on GitHub** — the Zenodo-hosted badge SVG was served with `Cache-Control: no-cache`, which GitHub's Camo image proxy cannot cache, so it displayed as a broken image; replaced with a shields.io static DOI badge (Camo-cacheable). The DOI value and link are unchanged (PR #50).

### Hygiene

- Validator precedent blocklist no longer stores the maintainer's name, mentor names, institutions, or project codes in cleartext: `scripts/validate_skills.sh` delegates to `scripts/check_precedent.py`, which keeps generic structural shapes as regex but matches sensitive identifiers against SHA-256 digests (`scripts/precedent_hashes.txt`), with an `--allow-author` exemption for citation files (PR #44).
- Fixed `/present-paper` note-injection script path (`references/` → `scripts/`) (PR #43).

### Stats

- 42 skills (was 40); Zenodo concept DOI `10.5281/zenodo.20155321` preserved.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-05-23

### Added — v2.10 cycle integration

- `/peer-review`: Phase 2A SR-MA 8-probe extension (P1-P8) for systematic review meta-analyses (PR #22).
- `/verify-refs`: Gate 5 PMID/DOI duplicate detection; `submission_safe` / `fully_verified` synchronous propagation (PR #23).
- `/meta-analysis`: SR-MA dual-extractor workflow, cohort overlap detection, and supplementary 8-file pack (PR #24).

### Changed

- Validator scope extended to `templates/` and `scripts/` for permanent PII blocklist enforcement.
- `setup-medsci` skill now reflected in the public skill roster so filesystem, README, and external mirrors can align at 40 skills.
- `README.md` refreshed with v2.10 public-surface highlights and 40-skill badge/text sync.

### Hygiene

- Generalized legacy non-hyphenated MA project codes in `skills/meta-analysis/SKILL.md`.
- Added the non-hyphenated MA project-code family to the validator blocklist.

### Stats

- 40 skills (was 39); Zenodo concept DOI `10.5281/zenodo.20155321` preserved.

## [3.0.1] - 2026-05-13

### Added — first Zenodo-archived release with DOI

- First release archived on Zenodo. **Concept DOI**: [`10.5281/zenodo.20155321`](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20155321) (always-latest); **versioned DOI for this release**: [`10.5281/zenodo.20155322`](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20155322).
- README DOI badge populated; `CITATION.cff` `doi:` field + `identifiers:` block added.
- Bumps `version: 3.0.1` in `CITATION.cff`.

This release archives the v3.0.0 Tier 0 polish bundle (see entry below) so it becomes academically citable. No code changes vs v3.0.0 except the DOI back-fill commit.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added — Tier 0 polish: CITATION.cff, Zenodo integration, setup onboarding, peer-review tone audit (2026-05-13)

- `CITATION.cff` (cff-version 1.2.0) and `.zenodo.json` for academic citation backlink. DOI populates after first Zenodo archive of a tagged release.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` — on `v*` tag push, builds classroom ZIPs, creates GitHub Release with notes from CHANGELOG, attaches ZIPs. Zenodo integration (toggle once at `https://zenodo.org/account/settings/github/`) auto-archives the release.
- `docs/setup/` — five-doc onboarding guide for clinicians new to Python/R/Claude Code/MCP: `README.md` (decision tree), `mac.md` (Homebrew → pyenv → R → Node → Claude Code), `windows.md` (winget-based, no WSL), `mcp-setup.md` (Zotero / Google Drive / PubMed servers), `common-issues.md` (top 10 issues with copy-paste fixes).
- `skills/setup-medsci/` — diagnostic-only skill that runs `which python3 / Rscript / claude / node` and `claude mcp list`, prints a checklist with status (✅ / ⚠️ / ❌) and links to the right setup doc for any missing component. Intentionally read-only — does not install anything.
- README: added `## What This Is NOT` scope-out section (positions vs K-Dense scientific-agent-skills and OpenClaw Medical Skills) and `## Setup` section linking the new docs and `/setup-medsci`. Citation badge added.
- GitHub topics: swapped 4 generic (`ai-tools`, `academic-writing`, `open-source`, `research-tools`) for 4 specific (`agent-skills`, `tripod-ai`, `irb-protocol`, `physician-researcher`) — capped at GitHub's 20-topic limit.
- `skills/peer-review/` — Aczel 2021 anti-reviewer-2 tone patterns integrated into Phase 4 Self-QC and Tone Calibration sections (PR #11 merged 2026-05-13).

### Changed — `/publish-skill` Phase 2 `audit_skill.sh` rewritten for parity with monorepo linter (2026-05-03)

`skills/publish-skill/scripts/audit_skill.sh` was overhauled to mirror the per-skill rules in `scripts/validate_skills.sh`. Old behavior had three structural problems: (1) raster bytes inside compiled `.pyc` and PNG images falsely tripped path / email regexes (a known-clean skill reported 3 findings), (2) the institutional-reference category used `(?<!...)` lookbehinds that `grep -E` silently does not support — the entire category was inert, (3) several monorepo rules had no equivalent here, so a personal skill that passed `audit_skill.sh` could still fail when moved into the public repo.

New coverage matches the monorepo categories one-for-one:

- **rule 6 / 7 / 7b** — text-pass with `--binary-files=without-match` so PNG / DOCX / pyc byte collisions stop generating findings.
- **rule 7c** — author-style filename pattern (`<Surname>{Year}_*`) with the same generic-token allow-list as the monorepo (`Issue`, `Sample`, `Example`, etc.).
- **rule 8** — blockquote dated precedent (`> YYYY-MM-DD ...`) with allow-list for routine version stamps (`Last updated:`, `Created:`, `Updated:`, `Date:`, `Version:`, `Released:`).
- **rule 10** — binary EXIF metadata scan via `exiftool` (DOCX / PPTX / XLSX / PDF / PNG / JPG / TIFF). exiftool is a soft dependency; the script prints a one-line install hint and continues if missing, so users without the binary can still get the other nine categories.
- **email whitelist** — `example.com` / `example.org` / `example.net` / `your@email` / `noreply@` / `placeholder` / `<your-email>` / `<email>` placeholders no longer flag.
- **institutional regex** — `(?<!...)` lookbehinds replaced with `\b` word boundaries so the rule actually fires.
- **single-file EXIF mode fix** — exiftool only emits `======== <file>` headers when given two or more files; the parser now pre-primes `current_file` from `binary_files[0]` so a one-file EXIF audit attributes hits correctly.

`skills/publish-skill/SKILL.md` Phase 2 was rewritten to enumerate the ten audit categories, document the second positional argument (user-specific name / institution / collaborator alternation pattern), and explain the false-positive guard. The "Cross-validation" section was scoped down to the things the script does not yet automate (uncommon institutional acronyms, project-specific identifiers like `CK-NN` / `MA-NN`).

Regression sweep across all 39 monorepo skills: **30 clean, 9 with legitimate generalization flags** (language hardcoding to a specific natural language, location-specific examples, institution names in documentation prose). The flagged set is the cross-publication scope by design — the medsci-skills internal `validate_skills.sh` deliberately allows these because the monorepo is medical-domain-specific, while `audit_skill.sh` enforces the broader publish-time scope.

### Changed — 14 skill contracts migrated from schema_version 1 → 2 (2026-05-03)

All remaining v1 skill.yml contracts (`calc-sample-size`, `check-reporting`, `lit-sync`, `manage-refs`, `meta-analysis`, `orchestrate`, `peer-review`, `render-pdf-doc`, `revise`, `search-lit`, `self-review`, `sync-submission`, `verify-refs`, `write-paper`) gained `layer:` (A/B/C/D per `docs/skill_yml_schema_v2.md`), `when_to_use:` (3–5 trigger entries each), and `when_NOT_to_use:` (3–5 routing-guard entries each). Existing v1 fields preserved verbatim; the only schema-level change is the bump to `schema_version: 2`. Closes the 2026-07-24 v1 sunset deadline; `validate_skill_contracts.py` now reports `v1 contracts: 0  |  v2 contracts: 15`.

Layer assignments follow the schema doc (`/verify-refs` → A, `/write-paper` → C, `/orchestrate` → D, `/self-review` → D, `/revise` → B) and infer the rest from skill role: deterministic-script skills (calc-sample-size, check-reporting, lit-sync, manage-refs, render-pdf-doc, search-lit, sync-submission) on Layer A; structured-data skills (meta-analysis) on Layer B; free-form prose skills (peer-review) on Layer C.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added — Binary EXIF metadata scan (validate_skills.sh rule 10)

`scripts/validate_skills.sh` now scans every shipped DOCX / PPTX / XLSX / PDF / PNG / JPG / TIFF for personal-name PII in document and image metadata. The text linter (rules 6 / 7 / 7b) cannot see fields like PDF `Author`, OOXML `dc:creator` / `cp:lastModifiedBy`, or EXIF `Artist`, so a personally-authored slide deck or annotated screenshot could ship with the author's real name in metadata while the file content read clean. Rule 10 closes that gap by piping the same `precedent_patterns` regex used for text scanning over an `exiftool -S` dump of `Author / Creator / LastModifiedBy / LastSavedBy / Copyright / Artist / Owner / OwnerName / CompanyName / Manager / HostComputer / UserComment / Subject / Title / Description / Keywords / Comment / Producer / CreatorTool / Software`. Upstream / 3rd-party document authors not in the precedent list (e.g., STARD's Patrick Bossuyt, the python-pptx maintainer) pass without an explicit allow-list. exiftool is now a hard dependency; the script exits early with an install hint if missing, and `.github/workflows/validate.yml` installs it via `apt-get` so server-side enforcement matches the local pre-commit hook.

Sanity-tested by injecting representative English- and Korean-script precedent identifiers from the blocklist into a tracked PNG's `Author` and `Artist` fields — both name forms are caught and FAIL on the next `validate_skills.sh` run, with cleanup automatically restoring the clean baseline.

### `/make-figures` v1.1.0 — design principles + flow diagram lessons (2026-05-03)

Adds a communication-first design layer to the figure pipeline and codifies five production lessons distilled from a multi-revision PRISMA Figure 1 cycle. The skill previously documented *which* figure type to use; v1.1.0 documents *what message to convey first* and *which template-fidelity / PDF-export pitfalls reliably waste a circulation round*. Skill contract bumped from schema_version 1 → 2 (sunset deadline 2026-07-24).

- **Added** — `skills/make-figures/references/design_principles.md` (~150 lines). Communication-first guide based on Brunner et al., *Nat Hum Behav* (2026) "Designing effective figures for scientific communication" (DOI: 10.1038/s41562-026-02466-9). Five strategies in reading order: (1) identify the one-sentence key message, (2) match the reading-time budget to the deployment context, (3) match graph type to data structure with intentional color use, (4) keep ≤7 visual elements / ≤3 colors per panel, (5) ask whether a figure is genuinely needed. Includes a figure-vs-table decision table, an audience-context matrix (specialist / generalist / mixed), a cognitive-load Step-4 checklist, and an anti-pattern list (default-palette syndrome, legend-dependence, decorative 3-D, chart-of-three-values, caption-as-Methods, mismatched detail).

- **Added** — `skills/make-figures/references/flow_diagram_lessons.md` (~150 lines). Five generalized lessons from a meta-analysis Figure 1 cycle (PII-scrubbed): (1) custom Graphviz prototypes are fine but switch to the official template before circulation, (2) headless LibreOffice corrupts PRISMA 2020 docx → PDF because of VML fallback drift; use macOS AppleScript / Windows COM driving native Word, (3) raw `str.replace` on `word/document.xml` breaks on `&`, `<`, `>` — always entity-escape via `xml.sax.saxutils.escape()` before substitution, (4) the PRISMA 2020 docx duplicates each numeric box as `<w:t>` pairs in non-rendering order; build a sequential placeholder map and validate with a `999`-sentinel render, (5) freeze figures alongside the manuscript v_N — never edit `figures/v3/*.pdf` after circulation, branch to `v4/` instead. Closes with a 4-row stage-vs-tool table that maps draft / QC / circulation / submission to the right approach.

- **Added** — `skills/make-figures/references/reporting_guideline_figure_map.md` (~140 lines). Bridges this skill to `/check-reporting` (33 reporting guidelines) by mapping 17 study designs and AI-extension guidelines to their mandatory figures and current support status: ✅ official template + R generator (PRISMA 2020, CONSORT 2025, STARD 2015, SPIRIT 2025, TRIPOD calibration), ⚠️ generic flow generator only (PRISMA-DTA, STROBE, CARE), ❌ no template — manual production via D2/Graphviz (CONSORT-AI 2020 PMID 32908283, STARD-AI 2025 PMID 40954311, TRIPOD+AI 2024 PMID 38636956, CLAIM 2024 PMID 38809149, DECIDE-AI 2022 PMID 35585198, PRISMA-NMA, PRISMA-P, CHEERS 2022, SQUIRE 2.0). Includes a "AI-specific figures most often missing" priority list (dataset-flow, calibration, fairness/subgroup panel, decision-curve analysis, architecture, saliency overlay) ranked by reviewer-checklist frequency.

- **Added** — `skills/make-figures/references/pipeline_concepts_medical_ai.md` (~200 lines). Four canonical diagram types not covered by reporting-guideline flows: (1) DICOM workflow (scanner → PACS → de-id → research store → splits), (2) annotation pipeline (annotator pool, consensus rule, inter-rater agreement), (3) federated learning topology (per-site cohorts, what flows between sites, aggregation algorithm), (4) model architecture (input shape, backbone, head, parameter count, trainable layers). Each section gives canonical layout, required annotations, common pitfalls, and preferred tool (D2 / drawio / NN-SVG / PlotNeuralNet). Closes with a 6-row "use this section if your figure shows…" selector.

- **Added** — `skills/make-figures/references/design_principles.md` companion citations: Rougier et al., *PLoS Comput Biol* 2014 (PMID 25210732) "Ten simple rules for better figures" — foundational general-purpose checklist; Crameri F., *Curr Protoc* 2024 (DOI 10.1002/cpz1.1126) "Choosing the right colors" — definitive 2024 reference for perceptually-uniform colorblind-safe palettes (`viridis` / `cividis` / `batlow`) and redundant encoding. Updated the Color section to recommend `vik` for diverging diagnostic data and to make redundant encoding explicit when color carries diagnostic meaning.

- **Changed** — `skills/make-figures/references/critic_rubrics/flow_diagram.md`. Appended Section G "Communication-first checks" with five new rubric items (22–26): cognitive load (≤7 boxes per column, ≤3 shapes, ≤3 colors), key-message visibility (analytic cohort visually emphasized within 2 seconds), official-template fidelity (PRISMA 2020 / CONSORT 2010 / STARD 2015 / STROBE), exclusion-box geometry (rectangles with `\l` left-aligned bullets, not `shape: note`), and frozen-version sync with the manuscript v_N path.

- **Changed** — `skills/make-figures/references/critic_rubrics/data_plot.md`. Appended Section G "Medical AI / prediction-model checks" with five new rubric items (21–25): calibration plot accompanies discrimination (TRIPOD+AI), subgroup/fairness panel for deployment claims (CLAIM 2024 §C, TRIPOD+AI), colorblind-safe + redundant encoding stronger than the existing D.13 (Crameri 2024), dataset-flow visible (STARD-AI / CLAIM 2024 / TRIPOD+AI), decision-curve analysis when the paper claims clinical utility (Vickers & Elkin, *Med Decis Making* 2006).

- **Changed** — `skills/make-figures/SKILL.md` Step 1 "Specify" now opens with a three-tier reading directive: (1) `design_principles.md` for every figure (key message + reading-time budget), (2) `reporting_guideline_figure_map.md` for any figure mandated by a reporting guideline, (3) `pipeline_concepts_medical_ai.md` for DICOM / annotation / federated / architecture diagrams. Step 4b "Critic Loop" Stage 2 now loads (a) `flow_diagram_lessons.md` for PRISMA / CONSORT / STARD / STROBE flows, (b) `reporting_guideline_figure_map.md` for AI-extension guidelines (CONSORT-AI / STARD-AI / TRIPOD+AI / CLAIM 2024 / DECIDE-AI) so the worker knows which figures the target guideline mandates, and (c) `pipeline_concepts_medical_ai.md` for AI/engineering pipeline figures.

- **Changed** — `skills/make-figures/SKILL.md` Journal AI-Image Policies section now declares an explicit sync pointer to `~/.claude/rules/journal-ai-image-policies.md` (the user's authoritative global rule), preventing the local copy from drifting silently when the policy table is updated upstream.

- **Changed** — `skills/make-figures/SKILL.md` triggers expanded with `key message`, `figure design`, `figure planning`, `effective figure`, and `cognitive load` so design-first prompts route here.

- **Changed** — `skills/make-figures/skill.yml` migrated to schema_version 2: added `layer: B`, `when_to_use` (5 entries covering /write-paper Phase 5 trigger, post-/analyze-stats visualization, PRISMA/CONSORT/STARD/STROBE flows, journal-specific abstracts), `when_NOT_to_use` (4 entries — tabular results → /analyze-stats, decorative slides → /present-paper, logos out of scope, AI images for prohibited targets), and `version: 1.1.0`. Existing `inputs / outputs / deterministic_scripts / side_effects / downstream_consumers / forbidden_actions` retained; `forbidden_actions` gained `generate_AI_images_for_prohibited_targets` to make the JACC / NEJM policy machine-checkable.

- **Added** — `skills/make-figures/scripts/validate_pptx_mac_compat.py` (~210 lines, deterministic). Codifies the four PowerPoint-Mac-only defect classes from `~/.claude/rules/pptx-mac-compatibility.md`: (1) TIFF images embedded in `ppt/media/` (Mac silently drops), (2) `<a:sp3d>` 3-D bevels (renders as red outlines invisible in PDF export), (3) `docProps/app.xml` slide-count mismatch with actual slide XML files (triggers PowerPoint recovery dialog), (4) `<a:srcRect>` values >100000 (1/1000-percent overflow → 99 % over-crop on Mac only). Pure-stdlib (zipfile + regex), no python-pptx dependency. Returns JSON report + human-readable summary; `--strict` exits 1 on any FAIL. Wired into SKILL.md Step 5 Export for any visual-abstract / central-illustration PPTX.

#### Cross-skill harmonization (2026-05-03)

- **Changed** — `skills/check-reporting/SKILL.md` Step 4d (PRISMA Figure 1 audit) now performs a `_figure_manifest.md` cross-check as step 3 of its procedure: verifies the manifest row whose Type matches the audit target points at the same source path and that the row's `Critic` field is not `no`. A missing row, mismatched path, or `Critic = no` logs `[MANIFEST-XREF]` (advisory). Skips silently if `_figure_manifest.md` does not exist (older projects). Closes the prior gap where a figure could pass the arithmetic audit while a parallel `_figure_manifest.md` recorded `critic_pass: no`.

- **Changed** — `skills/write-paper/SKILL.md` Phase 2 step 9 ("Manifest verification") promoted from advisory to **HALT gate** in autonomous mode. Previous behavior was log-and-continue, which silently dropped all figures from the Phase 7 DOCX build (manifest is the figure-embedding source at line 567). New behavior in `--autonomous`: HALT with `MANIFEST_MISSING` error code, log to `qc/_pipeline_log.md`, and write recovery instructions to `manuscript/<id>/REPORT.md` Tier-3 section. Interactive mode unchanged.

- **Changed** — `skills/present-paper/SKILL.md` slide-type templates section now declares the figure source-format contract for `T_image_right`: PNG ≥300 dpi preferred for slides, PDF only when projection >1080p (convert via `pdftoppm -r 300` first because python-pptx PDF embedding is unreliable across PowerPoint versions); TIFF / JPEG-for-line-art / raw-SVG forbidden. Caption contract: re-draft for spoken-narration context (5–10 s of attention) rather than copying journal legends verbatim.

#### Follow-up (deferred, not in this PR)

- 14 remaining skill.yml files still on schema_version 1 (deadline 2026-07-24).
- `scripts/generate_flow_diagram.R` itself unchanged — the new lessons live in references/ text only; codifying the lessons into the R generator (e.g., `--official-template` flag, `--sentinel` mode) is a separate PR.

### `/orchestrate --e2e` v4 integration — pre-flight + REPORT + Tier-3 guard (2026-05-01)

Folds the delegated-mode plan v4 into `skills/orchestrate/` so `/orchestrate --e2e` becomes a "single-researcher" mode: one delegation, no per-phase confirmations except the PHI gate, and a single REPORT.md the user reviews at the end. Replaces the earlier scheme that put the report template and the usage rule under `~/.claude/templates/` + `~/.claude/rules/` (both deleted) — the repo is now the only source of truth.

- **Added** — `skills/orchestrate/references/report_template.md`. Canonical 11-section REPORT layout written to `manuscript/<id>/REPORT.md` at every `--e2e` termination (success or halt). Sections: 한 줄 요약, Frozen / Version status, Source artifacts checked, 변경 파일, Changed claims, 검토 포인트, 환각 게이트 결과, QC artifact links, Human-only missing fields, Tier-3 차단 항목, 다음 액션 + Next safe command + Pipeline log. The Tier-3 section is split into hook-confirmed (`tier3-confirm.sh`) vs prompt/skill-guard-only blocks so a future hook regression cannot silently re-open a prompt-only block.

- **Changed** — `skills/orchestrate/SKILL.md` `### --e2e Flag` now opens with a Pre-flight Validation block (4 checks): STATUS / project_state, frozen artifact (v_N `_FROZEN` marker → v_(N+1) branch only), required inputs, dependency miss. Default on dependency miss is halt; `--auto-extend` is the only opt-in that prepends missing phases. PHI Safety Gate remains the only legitimate interrupt after pre-flight passes.

- **Added** — `skills/orchestrate/SKILL.md` `### REPORT.md Generation` section after Post-Skill Validation. Worker MUST write `manuscript/<id>/REPORT.md` from the new template at every `--e2e` termination. Empty fields render as `(none)` / `(unknown)` — never omitted. The §"Pipeline log" entry is a 5-line summary, not the full log.

- **Added** — `skills/orchestrate/SKILL.md` `### Tier-3 Worker Guard` section. Permanently forbids `--e2e` auto-entry into `git push`, `gh pr create`, MCP Gmail/Calendar send, MCP GitHub create-pr, `/sync-submission build` external publication paths, Phase 8 submission DOCX auto-build, and senior-mentor automatic email reply. `git commit` is allowed; subsequent `git push` halts. Reinforces the existing `### Post-E2E` boundary (Phase 8 already required explicit user invocation).

- **Changed** — `skills/orchestrate/SKILL.md` `check-reporting` row in the Available Skills table now reads "33 reporting guidelines and risk-of-bias tools" to match README and the skill's own SKILL.md (was stale at 22).

#### Follow-up (deferred, not in this PR)

- Release ZIP refresh — `dist/medsci-skills-classroom-*.zip` is stale at v2.1.1 / 37 skills (current 39, including `/manage-refs`, `/render-pdf-doc`, and the e2e+REPORT contract).
- skill.yml v1 → v2 contract migration — 15 skill.yml files still v1; v2 schema not yet adopted across the bundle.
- Mock test for frozen-artifact halt under `--e2e` (Plan v4 Verification §3) — current PR ships docs/contract only.

### Integration cleanup — orchestrator hardening + `/render-pdf-doc` adoption (2026-05-01)

End-to-end integration sweep after the parallel-session conflict around the manage-refs split. Three sessions had been editing the repo simultaneously (`/render-pdf-doc` spinoff, `/write-paper` backbone Phase 0, manage-refs split + circulation memo). This cleanup folds the surviving artifacts together, fixes the runtime breakage left in `/write-paper` Phase 7.6, registers the four previously-unrouted skills with `/orchestrate`, and standardizes per-skill `## Gates` sections.

- **Fixed (P0 blocker)** — `skills/write-paper/SKILL.md` Phase 7.6 hardcoded `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check_citation_keys.py` / `render_manuscript.sh` / `check_xref.py`, all of which moved to `/manage-refs` in the previous release. The hardcoded paths produced a runtime "file not found" the moment the autonomous pipeline tried to render a DOCX. Replaced all three with `${MEDSCI_SKILLS_ROOT:-$HOME/workspace/medsci-skills}/skills/manage-refs/scripts/...` and added a one-line delegation note pointing users at `/manage-refs` directly. The Phase summary table at line 861 was updated to label step 7.6 / 7.6a as `/manage-refs` calls.

- **Added** — `skills/render-pdf-doc/` (147-line SKILL.md + scripts/{render_pdf.sh, infer_colwidths.py, check_deps.sh} + 4 templates + 2 references). Skill renders non-bibliography academic markdown (proposal, briefing, anchor doc, IRB cover, reference table) to PDF via pandoc + xelatex with CJK font fallback (Apple SD Gothic Neo / Noto Sans CJK KR) and content-proportional pipe-table column widths. Boundary opposite of `/manage-refs scripts/render_pandoc.sh` (bibliography-driven). Origin: a calibration-anchor PDF that needed manual column-width fixes twice in succession.

- **Added** — `skills/render-pdf-doc/skill.yml` v1 contract (inputs / outputs / forbidden_actions / quality_gates). `bibliography_rendering`, `institutional_word_form_filling`, `figure_or_pptx_generation` are explicitly forbidden so the skill cannot drift into adjacent domains.

- **Changed** — `skills/orchestrate/SKILL.md` Available Skills table now includes `verify-refs`, `manage-refs`, `lit-sync`, `humanize`, `academic-aio`, `render-pdf-doc`, `fill-protocol`, `fill-icmje-coi`, `sync-submission`, `peer-review` (all previously referenced in workflows but not registered). Classification Logic gained 9 new routing rows (manage-refs, lit-sync, render-pdf-doc, fill-protocol, fill-icmje-coi, academic-aio, humanize, peer-review). Multi-skill Workflows table gained 6 new chains (Submission rendering & cascade reformat, Cascade rejection re-target, Non-bibliography academic deliverable, Reference housekeeping cycle, ICMJE COI batch, plus `/manage-refs` insertion into the existing "Draft exists, prepare for submission" chain). Standard Pipeline now lists `/manage-refs` as step 7 (DOCX build + xref QC `--strict` submission gate). Data Flow Contract table gained rows for lit-sync, manage-refs, render-pdf-doc, fill-protocol, fill-icmje-coi, sync-submission, peer-review.

- **Added** — `skills/orchestrate/references/dialogue_nodes.md` two new fork nodes: **N10** Reference Workflow (manage-refs Workflow A pandoc vs B Zotero CWYW vs hybrid 3-phase) and **N11** Protocol Delivery Format (`/fill-protocol` vs `/render-pdf-doc`). Defaults align with `~/.claude/rules/manuscript-references.md` (hybrid) and `~/.claude/rules/institutional-form-fill.md` (institutional template first).

- **Changed** — SSOT writer boundaries declared in `skill.yml`:
  - `skills/search-lit/skill.yml` — `references/library.bib` is search-candidate pool only; sole writer of `manuscript/_src/refs.bib` is `/lit-sync`. New forbidden_action: `write_to_manuscript_refs_bib`.
  - `skills/lit-sync/skill.yml` — declared sole writer of `manuscript/_src/refs.bib` (via Better BibTeX auto-export). New downstream consumer: `manage-refs`. New quality_gates: `refs_bib_refreshed`, `bbt_auto_export_active`. New forbidden_action: `hand_edit_manuscript_refs_bib`.
  - `skills/calc-sample-size/skill.yml` (new) — declares `protocol/sample_size_justification.md` + `sample_size_calc.{R,py}` as canonical outputs; `/write-protocol` and `/write-paper` embed verbatim, never rephrase numbers.

- **Changed** — `skills/write-protocol/SKILL.md` input contract for calc-sample-size now references `protocol/sample_size_justification.md` (canonical artifact path) and mandates verbatim embedding per `~/.claude/rules/numerical-safety.md`.

- **Changed** — `skills/manage-refs/SKILL.md` Anti-Hallucination Guarantees expanded with `[@NEW:topic]` placeholder convention. `check_citation_keys.py` classifies these as `NEW_PLACEHOLDER` (not UNDEFINED) so drafting can proceed; Phase 7.6 (DOCX render) is a hard gate where zero NEW_PLACEHOLDER entries must remain.

- **Added** — Per-skill `## Gates` sections classifying every gate as ENFORCED / ADVISORY / OPT-IN. Updated: `/write-paper` (13-row Phase 0–8+ table + cross-cutting rule list), `/self-review` (5 gates), `/check-reporting` (4 gates), `/humanize` (6 gates including Pattern 19–21 ENFORCED), `/revise` (6 gates including [VERIFY-CSV] tagging + post-revision `/verify-refs --strict`).

- **Added** — `docs/rule-application-map.md` — single-page matrix mapping every global rule (`~/.claude/rules/`) to the skill / phase that triggers it, with severity. Index only; rule bodies remain in the user's `.claude/rules/` directory.

- **Moved** — internal planning note for the `render-pdf-doc` skill from project-root scratchpad into the per-session planning area (now gitignored).

### Added — `/manage-refs` skill split (2026-05-01)

The reference-handling lifecycle (citekey validation, journal-CSL pandoc rendering, manuscript ↔ DOCX cross-reference QC, marker conversion, native Zotero CWYW field-code injection) was extracted from `/write-paper` Phase 7.6 into a new cross-cutting `/manage-refs` skill so it can be invoked uniformly from `/revise`, `/peer-review`, `/sync-submission`, and `/find-journal` (cascade rejection re-render). Validated against a 21-reference systematic-review manuscript, both pandoc-citeproc and Zotero-CWYW paths.

- **New skill** `skills/manage-refs/`:
  - `SKILL.md` (216 lines, MID tier) — decision tree, Workflows A–D (pandoc citeproc / Zotero CWYW / cascade rejection / cross-reference QC), Anti-Hallucination Guarantees (6 items), Quality Gates (3 submission gates + 1 user approval gate).
  - `skill.yml` — v1 contract with full `inputs / outputs / deterministic_scripts / side_effects / downstream_consumers / forbidden_actions` declaration plus provenance entry for the vendored Zotero CWYW writer.
  - `citation_styles/` — 9 journal CSL files relocated from `write-paper/references/citation_styles/` (european-radiology, radiology, AJR, CVIR, KJR, vancouver, vancouver-superscript, springer-basic-brackets, springer-vancouver-brackets).
  - `scripts/check_citation_keys.py`, `scripts/check_xref.py`, `scripts/render_pandoc.sh` — relocated from `write-paper/scripts/` (`render_manuscript.sh` renamed to `render_pandoc.sh`).
  - `scripts/md_marker_convert.py` (new) — generalized `[N]` ↔ `[@key]` converter, mapping-driven, supports `.md` and `.docx`, partial-conversion safe with `--active-ns`. Extracted and generalized from a per-project temporary `build_zotero_docx.py` replacer.
  - `scripts/inject_zotero_cwyw.py` (new) — wraps the vendored `citation_writer.insert_citations` and patches `zotero_to_csl_json` to fetch native CSL-JSON via Zotero's connector API (handles webpage / report / non-journal item types correctly, where the upstream `_ITEM_TYPE_MAP` falls back to `"article"` and silently drops fields).
  - `scripts/_vendor_citation_writer.py` (vendored) — from `alisoroushmd/zotero-mcp` @ `ed5dfb71`, MIT license. See `NOTICE.md` and `LICENSE.zotero-mcp`.
  - `references/check_xref_symptoms.md` — `MISSING_DOCX` / `MISSING_BODY` / `MISMATCH` / `UNCITED` triage table.

- **Dependents updated** to point at the new location:
  - `skills/write-paper/SKILL.md` Phase 7.6 — old in-skill scripts replaced with `/manage-refs` invocations + visible deprecation note. Old paths `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/{check_citation_keys.py, check_xref.py, render_manuscript.sh}` and `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/citation_styles/` are retired in this release.
  - `skills/verify-refs/SKILL.md` — companion citation-key check now references `/manage-refs/scripts/check_citation_keys.py`.
  - `skills/self-review/SKILL.md` Phase 2.5b — cross-reference QC invocation now references `/manage-refs/scripts/check_xref.py`.

- **Global rules** updated to single-source the new entry point:
  - `~/.claude/rules/agent-skill-routing.md` — added `/manage-refs` rows for lifecycle, CSL render, citekey check, cross-reference QC, and CWYW injection; `/verify-refs` clarified as audit-only.
  - `~/.claude/rules/manuscript-references.md` — pandoc pipeline section repointed at `manage-refs/scripts/render_pandoc.sh`, with `check_xref.py` step added inline.

### Added — Senior MA reviewer harvest

Lessons from senior meta-analysis mentor circulation feedback promoted into global rules and skill checklists, so subsequent manuscript circulations in the same pipeline do not repeat the same comments.

- **Global rules (5 files)** under `~/.claude/rules/`:
  - `manuscript-style-classical.md` (new) — 11-item style policy: `## **METHODS**` heading, abstract sub-headers `**Objectives:**`, eligibility numbered list, no `§` symbol, no AI Disclosure paragraph in body, em-dash <25, Vancouver 6+ et al., ORCID one-per-line, table header punctuation, British/American per journal.
  - `senior-mentor-circulation.md` (new) — mandatory `8_Review_Comments/` folder layout, 1차 source preservation, 1:1 verification, mentor README (per-mentor preference accumulation).
  - `ai-drafted-document-policy.md` (new) — verbatim absorption forbidden when senior mentors attach AI-drafted documents; `_DO_NOT_USE_VERBATIM` filename suffix mandatory; trust hierarchy SSOT > mentor direct text > AI-draft. Motivation: an AI-drafted directive presented a single-arm study as a two-arm comparison, with a denominator that did not exist in the source.
  - `data-integrity.md` — one-line augmentation cross-linking the AI-drafted policy.
  - `agent-skill-routing.md` — new "Cross-cutting 룰 (Manuscript / 회람)" table referencing the six rule files.

- **`/write-paper` Step 7.1 — Classical-style QC sub-step**:
  - `skills/write-paper/references/section_guides/step7_1_classical_qc.md` (new) — load-on-demand 7-grep checklist (`§` symbol, AI Disclosure paragraph, heading style, eligibility numbered list, Funding placeholder, PROSPERO chronology, em-dash overuse).
  - `skills/write-paper/SKILL.md` Step 7.1 — trigger table + load-on-demand pointer added.

- **`/humanize` Pattern 19–21**:
  - `skills/humanize/references/ai_patterns.md` — Pattern 19 (`§` section sign), Pattern 20 (Methods/Results self-reference parenthetical), Pattern 21 (AI Disclosure boilerplate in body) added with detection regex + rewrite guidance.
  - `skills/humanize/SKILL.md` — 18 → 21 patterns; section-specific focus extended to MA / SR Methods and Discussion.

- **`/meta-analysis` Phase 4.0 — AI-drafted starting document gate**:
  - `skills/meta-analysis/SKILL.md` — new sub-step at the top of Phase 4 (Data Extraction) requiring `_DO_NOT_USE_VERBATIM` filename suffix and source-PDF re-verification of every per-study N, denominator, event count, and effect estimate carried over from a senior mentor's AI-drafted directive. Trust hierarchy: SSOT > mentor direct text > AI-draft (never promote tier 3 to tier 2).
  - Cross-links `~/.claude/rules/ai-drafted-document-policy.md` (motivation: a denominator hallucination in an AI-drafted directive, caught at SSOT re-verification).

- **`/check-reporting prisma` Step 4d — PRISMA Figure 1 arithmetic & cross-reference audit**:
  - `skills/check-reporting/scripts/check_prisma_figure.py` (new) — extracts PRISMA numbers from manuscript body and Figure 1 source, runs 4 arithmetic equations (`screened = identified - duplicates`, etc.) and a body↔figure 1:1 cross-reference, emits `qc/prisma_figure_audit.json` + table. Exits 1 on any MISMATCH.
  - `skills/check-reporting/SKILL.md` Step 4d — invocation block + flagging policy (`[PRISMA-FIGURE]`, `fixable_by_ai: false`).
  - `skills/check-reporting/references/step4d_prisma_figure_audit.md` (new) — regex set, JSON schema, edge cases (multi-database, citation-searching strand, dual-reviewer screening, reports-vs-records terminology).

Resolves the meta-analysis project → medsci-skills handoff P1+P2.

### Added — Manuscript ↔ rendered DOCX cross-reference QC (`/write-paper` Step 7.6a + `/self-review` Phase 2.5d)

New 3-way audit catches the failure mode where in-text Table/Figure citations resolve to a different rendered caption because the build script carries its own legacy SSOT. Internal consistency (Phase 2.5) cannot detect it — both the prose and the build artifact echo their own divergent truths cleanly.

**The failure pattern:** the body cites a supplementary table as a sensitivity analysis while the rendered DOCX carries a different table under that number, further supplement numbers mismatch the same way, and some are cited but absent from the DOCX entirely. Caught only on co-author circulation review.

- `skills/write-paper/scripts/check_xref.py` — extracts (a) `(Supplementary )?(Table|Figure)\s+(S?\d+[A-Z]?)` in-text citations, (b) caption definitions from `## Tables` / `## Figures` / `## Supplementary {Tables,Figures}` body sections, (c) rendered DOCX caption paragraphs via python-docx. Emits `qc/xref_audit.json` with status codes `OK | MISSING_DOCX | MISSING_BODY | MISMATCH | UNCITED | NOT_CITED_NO_BODY`. Caption agreement via Jaccard ≥0.40. Panel-letter fallback (`Figure 2A` cite resolves to `Figure 2` caption). `--strict` exits 1 on any P0 finding.
- `/write-paper` Step 7.6a (new) — runs after Step 7.6 DOCX build, before Step 7.7 final gate. Submission gate; HALT pipeline on non-OK. Routing table for fixes by symptom (body update vs build-script update) — body caption is the SSOT, never the reverse.
- `/self-review` Phase 2.5d (new) — reuses the same script when a rendered DOCX exists. Translates findings to P0 Major Comments (category F, `fixable_by_ai: false`). Auto-fix forbidden in `--fix` mode (caption rewrites without rebuilding DOCX would only move the mismatch).

Resolves an internal improvement queue item (cross-reference QC, HIGH priority).

### Added — `/make-figures` flow diagram pipeline (R + DiagrammeR + rsvg)

New standardized flow-diagram generation for STROBE / CONSORT / PRISMA / STARD in a single R script, replacing the former D2 + matplotlib mix that caused repeated overlap, font, and DOCX-embed issues.

- `skills/make-figures/scripts/generate_flow_diagram.R` — CLI dispatcher: `--type {strobe|consort|prisma|stard} --config <yaml> --out <prefix>`. Reads a YAML node/edge spec, emits true vector PDF + 300 dpi PNG + 600 dpi PNG. Monochrome black outline on white fill, Arial, auto-overlap via Graphviz `dot` engine.
- `skills/make-figures/references/exemplar_diagrams/{strobe,consort,prisma,stard}/` — each directory now contains `template_input.yaml` + rendered `template_output.{pdf,png,_600.png}` so users can fork a concrete example.
- `skills/make-figures/references/exemplar_diagrams/strobe/` — new directory (previously missing alongside consort/prisma/stard).
- `skills/make-figures/references/exemplar_diagrams/README.md` — layout description extended to cover both "review anchors" (existing curator-curated PDFs) and "generation templates" (new).
- `skills/make-figures/SKILL.md` — "Flow diagram generation rule" rewritten to mandate the R pipeline as the single canonical tool. D2 recipe demoted to a legacy-fallback block. Tool Selection Guide table updated to route all four reporting-guideline flow diagrams through `generate_flow_diagram.R`.
- `skills/make-figures/references/figure_specs.md` — new "Flow Diagram Tool Selection" section documenting the stack choice, PRISMA 2020 compliance note, and rejection rationale for matplotlib / D2 / `consort` / `PRISMA2020` / Mermaid.

**System dependency:** `brew install librsvg` (macOS) or `apt-get install librsvg2-bin` (Linux). R packages: `DiagrammeR`, `DiagrammeRsvg`, `rsvg`, `yaml`.

**Validated end-to-end:** a STROBE cohort Figure 1 rebuilt with the new pipeline — single-color outline, no overlap, Arial rendered correctly for en-dash / bullet / `≤` / minus sign. Counts derived from a tracked cohort CSV. Legacy `create_figure1.py` and `figure1_flow.d2` preserved with `_legacy` suffix.

**Rollout:** retrofitted across multiple manuscripts spanning STROBE, STARD, PRISMA, PRISMA-DTA, and CONSORT-edu reporting guidelines.

- SKILL.md Flow-diagram section now documents the **per-project `create_figure1.R` pattern** (sprintf'd `dot` string + `stopifnot()` count reconciliation + multi-rank `{rank=same}` blocks) as the preferred route when the generic YAML dispatcher cannot express complex layouts.
- SKILL.md style rules hardened: **no HTML-like labels** (`label=<...>` with `<B>`/`<I>`/`&#8226;`) — plain quoted labels with `\l` bullets produce tighter, more readable structure than HTML ragged wrapping.

### Added — New skill `/academic-aio` + pipeline integration across README, write-paper, orchestrate

Medical AI paper optimization for AI search engines (Perplexity, ChatGPT web, Elicit,
Consensus, SciSpace) and RAG-based literature tools. Integrates TRIPOD+AI, CLAIM,
STARD-AI, TRIPOD-LLM, and DECIDE-AI reporting anchors with generative-engine-optimization
(GEO) principles from Aggarwal 2024 (arXiv:2311.09735). Scope covers title, abstract,
structured summary boxes (Key Points / Research in Context / Plain-Language Summary),
preprints, GitHub README, `CITATION.cff`, Zenodo, and Hugging Face model / dataset
cards. Explicit defense against LLM citation fabrication (Agarwal 2025, Nat Commun
doi:10.1038/s41467-025-58551-6, which reports up to 78–90% fabricated citations in
medical LLM answers). Produces a visible PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL checklist; never applies
edits silently (Communication Rules).

**Pipeline integration** (added in this release, not in the new skill itself):
- `README.md`: skill-table row added + main pipeline diagram branches
  `humanize → academic-aio` off the self-review / find-journal spine.
- `write-paper/SKILL.md` Skill Interactions table: new rows 7.5 (`/humanize`) and
  7.5a (`/academic-aio` opt-in `--aio`), running after `/self-review` Phase 7.4
  and before DOCX build (Phase 7.6).
- `orchestrate/SKILL.md`: (a) new multi-skill-workflow row "Medical-AI paper,
  AI-search visibility pass" with N4 + N9 nodes; (b) existing "Draft exists,
  prepare for submission" chain extended to `humanize → academic-aio (--aio)`;
  (c) new `--e2e` clause #8 specifying AIO is OFF by default in autonomous
  mode (AI-search visibility is a pre-submission, not a pre-draft, concern and
  autonomous silent rewrites would violate AIO's "never edit silently"
  contract) — opt-in via `--aio`, report always surfaced to user.
- Internal pipeline planning notes record the AIO-position rationale for 7.5a
  placement (after `check-reporting` so the Section 1.6 guideline anchor reflects
  real compliance; after `humanize` so the human-readability pass does not erase
  AIO edits; before DOCX build so the optimizations reach the final artifact)
  and the Anti-Hallucination division of labour with `search-lit` /
  `check-reporting` / `write-paper` / `humanize`.

**Anti-Hallucination block added to `/academic-aio` SKILL.md**: bars fabricated
citations / DOIs / arXiv IDs / reporting-guideline item numbers; bars invented
journal-specific summary-box rules (Lancet Digital Health "Research in context",
Radiology "Key Points", npj Digital Medicine); bars fabricated AI-search
discoverability metrics (Perplexity / Elicit / Consensus retrieval scores may
only be reported from recorded probes); bars auto-completion of CITATION.cff
and Zenodo author lists, ORCIDs, and affiliations. This closes the last
validator FAIL from the v2 content-integrity lint rollout.

**Skill count**: 32 → 33. Validator reports 265 PASS / 32 WARN / 0 FAIL after
these changes.

### Changed — Reference split for `/meta-analysis` Phase 4 & Phase 6 (R templates + KM/composite)

`/meta-analysis` SKILL.md had two oversized phases after the earlier Phase 9/10 split:
Phase 6 (Statistical Synthesis) ran 119 lines with full R code for DTA bivariate models,
intervention `metagen`/`metabin`, the dual-approach comparative + single-arm pooled
proportion decision table, practical R notes (method.tau, HK CI, zero-cell correction),
publication-bias test power, and sensitivity-analysis menu; Phase 4 (Data Extraction)
contained two specialised sub-procedures — KM curve reconstruction via WebPlotDigitizer
+ `IPDfromKM` (Guyot 2012) and composite-exposure disaggregation — that together ran
~40 lines. Both were moved to `references/phase6_statistical_synthesis.md` (148 lines)
and `references/phase4_km_composite.md` (58 lines), with SKILL.md bodies retaining a
one-table summary + load-on-demand pointer. Net impact: `/meta-analysis` 594 → 459
lines (−135, cumulative −281 from 740 pre-recovery-loop inlined state).

### Changed — Korean→English prose translation for `/ma-scout`, `/lit-sync`, `/grant-builder`, `/deidentify`

Four skills carried substantial Korean prose body text that tripped rule 9 of the v2
content-integrity lint (Korean outside code/tables/Communication Rules/frontmatter).
Translations preserve Korean domain terms in parenthetical references where they are
literal references to the Korean research system (Korean government agency names in
`/grant-builder`: 복지부=MOHW, 산자부=MOTIE, 중기부=MSS; Korean attachment names:
첨부1-3; Korean vault folder paths in `/lit-sync`: `02 연구/문헌/`, `02 연구/개념노트/`;
Obsidian note template headings in `/lit-sync` that must match the user's existing vault
convention: `## 서지 정보`, `## 핵심 내용`, `## 내 생각`, `## 관련 노트`). `/ma-scout`
also extracted the 72-line bilingual PROSPERO-ready README template block to
`references/project_readme_template.md` (includes Solo-Mode Adaptations for topic-first
mode without supervisor) and replaced the inlined block with a load-on-demand pointer.
Net impact: all four skills now pass lint rule 9 for SKILL.md body text; remaining
Korean is confined to frontmatter triggers (permitted), literal template content, and
Obsidian vault paths (the 32 outstanding WARNs are legitimate Korean-in-parenthesis
references that are not targeted by the rule).

### Changed — Reference split for `/meta-analysis` Phase 9/10, `/check-reporting` Step 4c, `/write-paper` Step 7.4a

The recently added recovery-loop phases were fully inlined in `SKILL.md` bodies,
inflating three skill files beyond what load-on-demand expects. Procedural detail was
extracted to new reference files (`meta-analysis/references/phase9_circulation.md`,
`phase10_recovery.md`, `check-reporting/references/step4c_registration_timing.md`,
`write-paper/references/section_guides/step7_4a_audit_recovery.md`) with SKILL.md bodies
retaining only the trigger table, routing table, and summary paragraph plus a
`Load-on-demand procedural detail` pointer. Net impact: `/meta-analysis` 740 → 594
lines (−146), `/check-reporting` 425 → 376 (−49), `/write-paper` 853 → 829 (−24). Pattern
follows the existing `checklists/QUADAS2.md` load-on-demand convention. All nine
content-integrity lints continue to pass.

### Added — `scripts/validate_skills.sh` v2 content-integrity lints + pre-commit hook

The validator previously checked frontmatter, size tiers, and reference integrity but
could not catch content regressions that had accumulated over prior sessions. v2 adds
four content-integrity rules scoped to shipped skill prose (`SKILL.md` plus
`references/**/*.md`, excluding `HANDOFF.md` and `TODO_*.md` meta-docs):
**Rule 6** blocks project-specific precedent identifiers (per-project IDs,
prior-citation slugs, ordinal-numbered paper labels) from leaking into shipped
skills; **Rule 7** blocks absolute personal home-directory paths in shipped
prose (scripts and exemplar `.meta.yaml` fixtures are out of scope); **Rule 8** flags dated precedent
blockquotes (`^> ... YYYY-MM-DD`) while allow-listing `Last updated:` / `Created:` /
`Updated:` / `Date:` meta-header prefixes; **Rule 9** warns on Korean prose in
`SKILL.md` body outside fenced code blocks, tables, blockquote examples, the
Communication Rules section, and frontmatter (Korean triggers remain permitted).
Rules 6–8 are FAIL-level; rule 9 is WARN-only pending per-skill translation
decisions. A `.git/hooks/pre-commit` hook runs the validator automatically when any
`skills/**/*.md` or the validator itself is staged, early-exiting otherwise to keep
non-skill commits fast.

### Changed — `/orchestrate` Dialogue Protocol is now the default interactive execution path

The prior interactive flow was a plain bulleted plan followed by "Shall I proceed with
step 1?" — a confirmation that surfaced no lock-in cost. The revised **Workflow Execution
— Dialogue Protocol** section makes per-fork decision-node rendering the primary control
flow: identify the node, render the template (context + numbered options + per-option
`unlocks` / `locks` / `recovery_cost`), wait for a numeric choice or a control word
(`back` / `pause` / `skip`), echo the lock in one line, invoke the matched skill, and
return for the next fork. The Multi-Skill Workflows table gained a **Nodes** column that
maps each scenario to the N1 – N9 node IDs. The `--e2e` Flag section now prescribes
node-by-node default application with per-node logging to `qc/_pipeline_log.md`, and
specifies that the PHI gate (N6) is the sole node that can HALT autonomous mode, while
Audit Recovery (N8) HALTs only when the routed recovery fails validation twice. The
Output Format multi-skill example was replaced with a worked N2 Paper Type rendering to
anchor downstream rendering style.

### Added — `/orchestrate` Dialogue Mode prototype (RPG-style decision nodes)

`/orchestrate` previously executed multi-skill pipelines with plan-then-confirm but
did not surface the downstream cost of each commitment (paper type, study design,
target journal timing, MA synthesis scope, audit recovery branch). The new
**Dialogue Mode** is the interactive default: at each major fork, the orchestrator
renders a decision node (context, numbered options, per-option `unlocks` / `locks` /
`recovery_cost`) and the user picks a number. `--autonomous` / `--e2e` bypasses the
rendering and uses each node's `default`, logging the choice to
`qc/_pipeline_log.md`. The prototype lists 9 primary nodes — entry classification,
paper type, study design (STARD/CONSORT/STROBE/TRIPOD+AI), target-journal timing
(commit-now vs. late-bind), MA synthesis depth (primary / +subgroups / +sensitivity /
+meta-regression), PHI Safety Gate, autonomy flag, Step 7.4a audit recovery branch,
and `/write-paper` section entry on re-entry — with rendering templates and
autonomous-default rationales. Load-on-demand reference at
`skills/orchestrate/references/dialogue_nodes.md`; `SKILL.md` body gains only a
one-paragraph pointer to preserve token economy.

### Added — `/meta-analysis` Phase 9 (Co-author Circulation) + Phase 10 (Self-Audit Recovery)

The pipeline previously stopped at Phase 8 (Reporting & Manuscript), leaving two operational
loops undocumented. **Phase 9** standardizes pre-submission circulation: thread-reply
continuity, attachment scope (body + change summary only; exclude GA / cover letter / COI
until journal is confirmed), recipient structure (corresponding + one senior methodologist
TO, co-authors CC), the 7-day deadline rule, and journal-undetermined framing. **Phase 10**
formalizes the v{N} → v{N+1} rebuild sprint when an audit uncovers structural data or
protocol-application errors — audit log, CSV re-verification, analysis re-run, manuscript
auto-sync, figure regeneration, change summary, protocol-registry amendment in parallel,
and the transparent re-circulation framing. Triggers include extraction ↔ source
mismatch, protocol-analysis disagreement, hand-typed script literal errors, and
consensus-record ↔ locked-dataset disagreement. Anti-patterns (hide & submit, reframe as
"minor revision", cover-letter-only disclosure) are documented as do-not.

### Added — `/write-paper` Step 7.4a Audit Recovery Branch

Phase 7 polish was a linear flow (draft → review → revise → submit) that silently proceeded
past structural self-review findings. Step 7.4a makes the recovery loop explicit: when
Step 7.4 returns a fatal `accuracy`, `data_fidelity`, `protocol_mismatch`, or
`numerical_claim` issue, an unresolved Step 7.3a primary-source disagreement, a persistent
`[VERIFY-CSV]` tag, or a registry ↔ analysis inconsistency, the pipeline halts Steps 7.5 –
7.6 and routes to the appropriate upstream recovery. For MA manuscripts this is
`/meta-analysis` Phase 10; for non-MA manuscripts with extraction errors, back to
`/write-paper` Phase 2; protocol amendments halt for human decision. On re-entry the
pipeline resumes at Step 7.3, not Step 7.1, because recovery may have introduced new
citations. Loop budget: one recovery cycle expected; a second cycle on the same manuscript
prompts a root-cause review of Phase 2 / 6 / 6b.

### Added — `/check-reporting` Step 4c Registration / Protocol Timing Consistency Check

The registration identifier alone is a single checklist item and passes even when the
manuscript is internally inconsistent about registration / amendment timing. Step 4c
audits five consistency items: registration identifier present in Methods/Abstract/
cover letter, registration date ↔ screening/extraction milestone order, amendment date ↔
Methods-described change agreement, cross-artifact agreement between Methods and the
registry record (e.g., PROSPERO PDF), and retrospective-registration disclosure when
the registration date post-dates extraction start. Findings carry the
`[REGISTRATION-TIMING]` label in Part C Action Items, with `fixable_by_ai: false` when
reconciliation requires an external amendment filing. A new `registration_timing` JSON
field is emitted in Part D. Applies to PRISMA 2020, PRISMA-DTA, PRISMA-P, MOOSE, CONSORT,
and SPIRIT. Common Gaps list updated to include amendment-date consistency as item #2.

### Added — Verified neurointervention/cerebrovascular journal profiles

- **JNIS (Journal of NeuroInterventional Surgery)** — compact + detail profiles built from user-supplied author-guidelines PDF (BMJ, SNIS). Covers double-anonymised review, ORCID mandate, BMJ Tier 3 data-sharing policy, Key Messages box requirement, AI policy aligned with BMJ/ICMJE.
- **Journal of Stroke** (Korean Stroke Society) — compact + detail profiles from user-supplied author-guidelines PDF. Full OA CC BY-NC 4.0 with no APC; Vancouver numbered references; structured 250-word abstract for Original Articles; mRS/mTICI/sICH definition requirements; AI policy defaults to ICMJE/WAME (no explicit journal-specific text).
- **Stroke (AHA/ASA)** — compact + detail profiles from user-supplied author-instructions PDFs. ISSN verified against ISSN Portal (print 0039-2499 / online 1524-4628, ISSN-L 0039-2499). Three-category science triage (Basic/Translational, Clinical, Population); structured 300-word abstract; Vancouver references listing first 10 authors + "et al."; 90-day revision window with mandatory Graphic Abstract at revision; explicit AI policy per AHA/ICMJE.

All three profiles follow the two-tier public-library format established by `INSI.md` and include a verification note citing the source author-guidelines PDF.

### Added — `/find-journal` Phase 3.6 Profile Coverage Advisory

Previously, when the public profile library had a known gap for the manuscript's field,
the ranking silently substituted adjacent journals and the user never learned that a
better-fitting target existed. The new Phase 3.6 scans `skills/find-journal/TODO_*_profiles.md`
files, matches their `## Field Keywords` block against the manuscript's themes, and appends
a Coverage Advisory block between the comparison note and the Mandatory Disclaimer when
a relevant TODO has still-missing journals. The advisory names the missing journals,
cites their publisher and 1-line rationale verbatim from the TODO file, and directs the
user to `/add-journal` with a PDF to close the gap per `POLICY.md`. No false alarms when
no TODO is relevant.

`TODO_neurointervention_profiles.md` updated with a `## Field Keywords` section so it
feeds the advisory. Future field TODO files should follow the same convention.

### Added — `/write-paper` Step 7.3a trigger 5 (reporting-quality checklist SRs)

Step 7.3a Numerical Claim Audit previously fired only on pooled estimates, comparative-arm
values, `[VERIFY-CSV]` tags, or post-v1 revisions. It missed the reporting-quality
systematic review pattern, where all headline numbers are derived by counting cells in an
items × studies checklist matrix (TRIPOD+AI, PROBAST+AI, CLAIM, PRISMA, STARD, CHARMS,
ARRIVE). The same failure class applies — hand-tallied totals drift from cell-level truth
while every downstream artifact echoes the wrong number.

Trigger 5 is now mandatory whenever the manuscript reports corpus-level, study-level, or
item-level PRESENT / PARTIAL / ABSENT / compliance counts or percentages from a checklist
synthesis. The procedure adds five steps specific to this pattern: per-study totals
recomputation, corpus-level Σ non-NA denominator, item-level roll-up, 3-way consistency
(manuscript ↔ per-study JSON ↔ summary document), and a reproducible audit script that
emits `numerical_claims_log.csv` and exits non-zero on any mismatch.

A companion rule is recorded in `~/.claude/rules/numerical-safety.md` so the gate
triggers even in non-skill workflows.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-04-19

### Added — Numerical Hallucination Prevention Layer

A real incident during a revision run exposed that the citation-safety pipeline did not have
a symmetric counterpart for numerical claims. Citations were verified end-to-end against
PubMed (0 fabricated refs), while a hand-typed `matrix()` in a revision-era R script silently
reversed a Fisher exact 2x2, flipping the arm-level events and therefore the p-value relative
to what the source Table recorded. Every internal consistency check passed because every artifact echoed the same
wrong number. Detection required an explicitly requested second-pass audit with random
sampling against the primary paper.

To close that gap, four skills now enforce a common 3-layer (CSV ↔ analysis script ↔
manuscript) audit, with additional back-checking against the primary paper for revisions and
pooled estimates:

- **`/meta-analysis` Phase 6b — Post-Analysis Source Fidelity Audit (new).** After Phase 6
  statistical synthesis, mandates no hand-typed numerical matrices when a CSV exists,
  separate consensus-log rows for comparative-arm subsets, and a random 3-claim back-check
  (manuscript → R output → primary-source Table/Figure) before advancing to GRADE. A single
  mismatch is a P0 blocker.
- **`/self-review` Phase 2.5a — Numerical Source-Fidelity Audit (new).** Complements the
  existing Phase 2.5 internal consistency check with external validation: stratified random
  sampling of 5 claims, 3-layer traversal (manuscript ↔ CSV ↔ primary paper), and escalation
  of any mismatch to Major Comment. Revision-introduced numbers and comparative-arm specific
  values are the two highest-yield strata and are always sampled.
- **`/revise` Step 2.5 — Revision Numerical Lineage Check (new).** Any `/analyze-stats`
  re-run during revision must tag new numerical claims with `[VERIFY-CSV]`, read inputs from
  the locked extraction CSV, and maintain a response-document audit table that maps each new
  number to its source script:line + CSV coordinate + primary-source location. Prose
  generation is gated on the audit clearing.
- **`/write-paper` Step 7.3a — Numerical Claim Audit (new).** Sits alongside the existing
  citation verification step. Triggered whenever the manuscript contains pooled estimates,
  comparative-arm values, `[VERIFY-CSV]` tags, or is a post-v1 revision. Greps all analysis
  scripts for hand-typed numerical literals without CSV-coordinate comments and flags them
  as structural risks regardless of current correctness.

All four skills reference the revision-era Fisher-exact reversal pattern described above as
a concrete failure mode rather than an abstract risk. Complementary companion rules were
added to `~/.claude/rules/data-integrity.md` and a new `~/.claude/rules/numerical-safety.md`
so the gates trigger even in non-skill workflows.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- **`/meta-analysis` Phase 3 multi-round screening structure**: Phase 3a now distinguishes Round 1 (single-reviewer initial screen), Round 2 (dual independent screen with Cohen's kappa), Round 3 (first-reviewer adjudication of disagreements), Round 4 (full-text), and PRISMA flow.
