# Locale Inventory

**Status: migration complete (PR1–PR4).** The English-canonical migration has landed — incidental
Korean prose is translated (PR2) and the Korean-default skills now default to English with opt-in
`*_ko` variants (PR3). The rows below document the Korean-bearing files, each a
functional locale feature (A), a Korean-jurisdiction mode (A2), a bilingual trigger (D), or an
opt-in `*_ko`/locale variant. `check_locale_inventory.py --strict` is clean.

This file is the **auditable allowlist** for non-English (currently Korean) text under `skills/`.

Policy: skill mechanics and prose are English-canonical. Non-English is allowed **only** as a
labeled locale feature, a locale-jurisdiction mode, a bilingual trigger, or an opt-in `*_ko`
variant — and every such file must appear in the table below with a reason. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#language-policy) for the principle.

**Enforcement:** `scripts/check_locale_inventory.py` asserts that every file matched by
`grep -rl '[가-힣]' skills/` is listed here. A Korean-bearing file that is *missing* from this
table fails the check (CI). As translation/redesign PRs land, their rows are removed (the file no
longer contains Korean); the steady state is only the **KEEP** rows.

Buckets:
- **A** — locale feature: Korean is functional (locale data, language-specific parsing/examples, Korean PII detection). KEEP.
- **A2** — locale-jurisdiction mode: a Korean-domain workflow with English wrapper prose + preserved Korean artifact terms. KEEP.
- **B** — incidental prose: translate to English (PR2). Transitional row, removed when translated.
- **C** — Korean-default behavior/output: redesign to English-default + Korean opt-in `*_ko` variant (PR3). Transitional row.
- **D** — bilingual `triggers:` field (frontmatter): additive recognition aliases. KEEP.

> Note: several SKILL.md files carry both a **D** trigger line and **A** locale content; they are
> listed once under their KEEP rationale. Mixed B+C files are handled wholly in one PR (PR3) to
> avoid a single file straddling two PRs.

## KEEP — locale features (Bucket A)

| Path | Bucket | Why retained |
|---|---|---|
| `skills/deidentify/locales/kr.json` | A | Korean PHI locale data (RRN/phone/address patterns) — the feature. |
| `skills/deidentify/references/korean_phi_patterns.md` | A | Korean PHI pattern reference. |
| `skills/deidentify/references/hipaa_18_identifiers.md` | A | HIPAA ↔ Korean identifier mapping (성명/주민등록번호/개인정보보호법). |
| `skills/deidentify/references/date_shift_guide.md` | A | Korean date-format examples (차트번호, `2024년 3월 15일`) for date-shift logic. |
| `skills/deidentify/tests/test_phi_korean.csv` | A | Korean PHI test fixtures. |
| `skills/deidentify/tests/test_edge_cases.csv` | A | Korean edge-case test fixtures. |
| `skills/deidentify/tests/README.md` | A | Documents the Korean placeholder test names (김철수 etc., synthetic). |
| `skills/deidentify/deidentify.py` | A | Korean date parsing (년/월/일) + bilingual `Select country / 국가 선택` prompt. |
| `skills/deidentify/SKILL.md` | A/D | Locale-pack description (kr: 주민번호 …) + bilingual trigger. |
| `skills/contribute/SKILL.md` | A/D | Bilingual triggers (`기여`, `오탐 신고`) so a Korean-speaking clinician reaches the contribution flow in the words they would actually use. |
| `skills/contribute/scripts/check_contribution_safety.py` | A | Korean PHI/identifier patterns — a Korean resident-registration number, `생년월일`, a hospital name (`…병원`/`…의료원`), an honorific naming a colleague (`…교수님`). This is the scanner that stops patient data leaving a Korean clinician's laptop; without these patterns it does not work where most of the users are. |
| `skills/find-cohort-gap/scripts/build_cohort_profile.py` | A | Codebook column-header aliases: a Korean hospital registry's data dictionary labels its description column `설명` / `한글`, and the adapter must recognise it to read the codebook at all. Language-specific parsing, not prose. |
| `skills/publish-skill/SKILL.md` | A | Language-hardcoding **detection** patterns (`한국어로`, `<한글이름> 교수님`) — the feature. |
| `skills/publish-skill/scripts/audit_skill.sh` | A | Korean PII/name detection regex. |
| `skills/publish-skill/references/pii-patterns.md` | A | Korean PII pattern examples for the auditor. |
| `skills/sync-submission/scripts/check_asset_anonymization.py` | A | Korean institution-token **detection** regex (`병원\|의료원\|의과대학\|대학교\|연구윤리`) for the asset-anonymization gate — the feature. |
| `skills/present-paper/scripts/inject_pronunciation_notes.py` | A | Korean pronunciation dictionary for Korean-presenter speaker notes. |
| `skills/present-paper/SKILL.md` | A/D | `[ 발음 ]` pronunciation-section header example + bilingual trigger. |
| `skills/present-paper/references/mode_a_build.md` | B | A practitioner quote ("draw diagrams as code, then insert") moved verbatim from `present-paper/SKILL.md` when the Mode A build internals were extracted; it is prose, not a locale feature, and is a candidate for translation. |
| `skills/fill-protocol/SKILL.md` | A/D | Korean institutional-form fill examples + `맑은 고딕` font + bilingual trigger. |
| `skills/fill-protocol/scripts/fill_form.py` | A | `맑은 고딕` default CJK font for Korean .docx forms. |
| `skills/fill-protocol/examples/example_irb_template.yaml` | A | Korean IRB template example (`국문`, `맑은 고딕`). |
| `skills/fill-protocol/references/best_practices.md` | A | `맑은 고딕` font + a Korean IRB form-label matching demo (`연구대상자 정보`, whitespace normalization) — translating it would break the demonstrated feature. |
| `skills/sync-submission/scripts/blind_sweep.py` | A | `성명` shown as a native-script (hangul) example. |
| `skills/sync-submission/scripts/author_registry_example.yaml` | A | `성명` as a hangul `native_names` example comment. |
| `skills/replicate-study/references/harmonization_knhanes_nhanes.csv` | A | KNHANES authoritative Korean variable labels (`개인아이디`, `조사연도`). Notes already English. |
| `skills/replicate-study/references/harmonization_3country.csv` | A | KNHANES authoritative Korean variable labels. |
| `skills/define-variables/SKILL.md` | A/D | KNHANES-style dictionary sheet/row example (`5-1.복부초음파 r12`) + bilingual trigger. |
| `skills/render-pdf-doc/references/pandoc_korean_cheatsheet.md` | A | Korean-PDF rendering reference (the skill renders Korean academic PDFs). +label in PR3. |
| `skills/render-pdf-doc/references/known_pitfalls.md` | A | Korean-PDF rendering failure-mode demonstrations. +label in PR3. |
| `skills/render-pdf-doc/tests/test_font_faces.py` | A | Synthetic Hangul glyphs distinguish CJK coverage from Greek coverage across font collection faces. |

## KEEP — Korean-domain mode (Bucket A2)

| Path | Bucket | Why retained |
|---|---|---|
| `skills/grant-builder/SKILL.md` | A2 | "Korean Government Grant Mode" — English prose already wraps preserved KR program terms (첨부1/2/3, 산학과제). PR4 adds the locale label + this row. |

## KEEP — bilingual triggers only (Bucket D)

| Path | Bucket | Why retained |
|---|---|---|
| `skills/add-journal/SKILL.md` | D | Korean only in `triggers:` (`저널 프로필 추가`). |
| `skills/author-strategy/SKILL.md` | D | Korean only in `triggers:` (body example query translated in PR2). |
| `skills/batch-cohort/SKILL.md` | D | Korean only in `triggers:`. |
| `skills/ma-scout/SKILL.md` | D | Korean only in `triggers:` (body tables translated in PR2). |
| `skills/cross-national/SKILL.md` | D | Korean only in `triggers:` (한미 비교 …). |
| `skills/find-cohort-gap/SKILL.md` | D | Korean only in `triggers:`. |
| `skills/humanize/SKILL.md` | D | Korean only in `triggers:`. |
| `skills/polish-language/SKILL.md` | D | Korean only in `triggers:`. |
| `skills/peer-review/SKILL.md` | D | Korean only in `triggers:`. |
| `skills/replicate-study/SKILL.md` | D | Korean only in `triggers:`. |
| `skills/setup-medsci/SKILL.md` | D | Korean only in `triggers:`. |

## TRANSLATE — incidental prose (Bucket B → PR2)

**PR2 complete.** All incidental-prose files were translated to English and dropped out
(they no longer contain Korean): `humanize/references/ai_patterns.md`, the four
`meta-analysis/references/*.md`, `meta-analysis/SKILL.md`,
`define-variables/templates/variable_operationalization.md`,
`define-variables/references/common_definitions.md`,
`check-reporting/references/step4d_prisma_figure_audit.md`,
`write-paper/references/section_guides/step7_1_classical_qc.md`,
`orchestrate/references/dialogue_nodes.md`, and
`peer-review/references/reviewer_profiles/RYAI.md` (its ScholarOne field labels were already
English, so the file is now fully English).

Three files originally scoped as B were reclassified during translation and remain
inventoried under their new bucket:
- `skills/fill-protocol/references/best_practices.md` → **A** (Korean is a functional
  Korean-form-matching demo + font name, not incidental prose).
- `skills/ma-scout/SKILL.md` → **D** (body tables translated; only the `triggers:` line remains).
- `skills/author-strategy/SKILL.md` → **D** (example query translated; only the `triggers:` line remains).

## REDESIGN — English-default + Korean opt-in (Bucket C → PR3)

**PR3 complete.** Each Korean-default behavior/output now defaults to English; Korean is preserved
as an opt-in `*_ko` variant or via a "communicate in the user's preferred language" instruction.

Translated to English and dropped from the inventory (paths shown without the `skills/` prefix so
they are not re-counted here): analyze-stats/SKILL.md and make-figures/SKILL.md (PHI prompts);
fill-icmje-coi/SKILL.md body (co-author email); write-paper/SKILL.md (Q1–Q5 + Discussion-review +
classical-QC table); present-paper/templates/build_pptx_nature_lancet.py and
present-paper/references/medical_presentation_templates.md (notes-language docstrings/directives);
render-pdf-doc/SKILL.md body + render-pdf-doc/skill.yml; and the four render-pdf-doc/templates/*.md
+ orchestrate/references/report_template.md + ma-scout/references/project_readme_template.md (now
English defaults, each with a `_ko` sibling below).

### KEEP — opt-in Korean variants (`*_ko` / locale)

| Path | Bucket | Why retained |
|---|---|---|
| `skills/render-pdf-doc/templates/anchor-doc_ko.md` | C-ko | Korean starter; English default is `anchor-doc.md`. |
| `skills/render-pdf-doc/templates/proposal-cover_ko.md` | C-ko | Korean starter; English default is `proposal-cover.md`. |
| `skills/render-pdf-doc/templates/briefing-handout_ko.md` | C-ko | Korean starter; English default is `briefing-handout.md`. |
| `skills/render-pdf-doc/templates/reference-table_ko.md` | C-ko | Korean starter; English default is `reference-table.md`. |
| `skills/orchestrate/references/report_template_ko.md` | C-ko | Korean REPORT variant; English default is `report_template.md`. |
| `skills/ma-scout/references/project_readme_template_ko.md` | C-ko | Korean PI-facing README variant; English default is `project_readme_template.md`. |
| `skills/lit-sync/references/locale/ko/note_templates.md` | C-ko | Korean Obsidian vault layout + note templates; English defaults inline in lit-sync SKILL.md. |
| `skills/obsidian-paper-vault/references/locale/ko/note_templates.md` | C-ko | Korean Obsidian vault layout + note templates for the PDF-side builder; English defaults inline in obsidian-paper-vault SKILL.md. Mirrors the lit-sync ko locale so both skills write one vault the same way. |

### Reclassified survivors (Korean is functional; remain inventoried)

| Path | Bucket | Why retained |
|---|---|---|
| `skills/fill-icmje-coi/SKILL.md` | D | Body translated; only the `triggers:` line remains. |
| `skills/render-pdf-doc/SKILL.md` | D | Body + skill.yml translated; only the `triggers:` line remains. |
| `skills/orchestrate/SKILL.md` | A | PHI prompts + §-name translated; bilingual routing-table recognition phrases kept (functional, validator-skipped table rows). |
| `skills/lit-sync/SKILL.md` | D | English-default vault/headings; `triggers:` line + honor-existing Korean-folder examples documenting the detect-and-honor behavior. |
| `skills/obsidian-paper-vault/SKILL.md` | D | English-default vault/headings; `triggers:` line + one honor-existing Korean-folder example documenting the detect-and-honor behavior. |
| `skills/obsidian-paper-vault/references/workflow.md` | A | Korean folder names appear as honor-what-exists examples of real vault layouts, not as output prose. |
| `skills/present-paper/references/generate_pptx_templates.py` | A | Legacy Korean slide-marker parser regex (backward compatibility). |
| `skills/present-paper/references/slide_visual_styles/nature_lancet.md` | A | Korean-glyph rendering verification grep. |
| `skills/present-paper/scripts/check_deck_budget.py` | A | Backup-section markers a divider may carry in Korean (백업 / 부록 / 예비), so a Korean deck's Q&A section stops the clock like an English one. Recognition data, not prose. |
| `skills/present-paper/tests/test_backup_off_the_clock.py` | A | Fixture for the Korean backup markers above. |

### AI-slide-tell detection (Korean is the evidence, not a translation)

The critiques that motivated `check_slide_tells.py` were written in Korean, and the scaffolding
phrases the detector matches **are Korean strings** — "요약하자면", "핵심은 ~라는 점이다", "이는 세
가지 층위에서 살펴볼 수 있다". A Korean deck built from an English brief still comes out with these
in it, so the pattern bank has to carry them. Translating the quoted critique into English would
also destroy it: the point of quoting a reviewer verbatim is that it is what they said.

| Path | Bucket | Why retained |
|---|---|---|
| `skills/present-paper/scripts/check_slide_tells.py` | A | Korean scaffolding-phrase patterns are the detector's subject matter — they must match Korean slide text. |
| `skills/present-paper/scripts/check_slide_tells_challenge/make_fixtures.py` | A | The positive fixture plants Korean scaffolding phrases; the detector must find them. |
| `skills/present-paper/references/ai_slide_tells.md` | A | Quotes the source critiques verbatim (reviewers, an investor, a practitioner). Paraphrasing a verbatim quote is not a translation, it is a fabrication. |
| `skills/present-paper/references/critic_rubrics/slide.md` | A | Names the Korean scaffolding phrases a reviewer must look for. |
| `skills/present-paper/templates/build_pptx_nature_lancet.py` | A | One Korean quote in a comment, explaining why the eyebrow/footer default was removed. |
| `skills/present-paper/tests/test_builder_no_chrome.py` | A | Same quote, explaining what the test is defending against. |
| `skills/present-paper/references/presentation_archetypes.md` | A | One verbatim quote from an investor explaining why they tell founders never to use AI for an IR deck — the sentence is the evidence for the archetype's warning, and paraphrasing a quote is not translation. |
| `skills/present-paper/scripts/check_font_portability.py` | A | The blocklist matches typeface names as a deck writes them, and a Windows Korean face is written `맑은 고딕` in the OOXML as often as `Malgun Gothic`. Translating the key would stop it matching. |
| `skills/present-paper/scripts/check_font_portability_challenge/make_fixtures.py` | A | The fixture that proves an inherited default fires needs real Korean on the slides — with Latin text the theme's East-Asian fallback is inert and the test would assert nothing. |
| `skills/present-paper/references/spoken_notes_and_bilingual.md` | A | The failure modes it documents are language-specific and cannot be shown in English. A parallel list that drops its predicate (`맞춰 달라, 만들어 달라`) is grammatical in Korean and unspeakable aloud; the repeated-opener check needs a real opener (`…하고 가겠습니다`); the bilingual-label example (`Reading room / 판독실`) is the defect itself. All headings, rules, and prose are English — the Korean is the specimen. |
