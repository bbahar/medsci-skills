# present-paper

> Academic presentation preparation — paper-driven (journal club, grand rounds, seminar) and lecture/teaching decks (course material, workshop slides, conference talks). Analyzes source material, finds supporting references, drafts audience-adapted speaker scripts, generates or augments PPTX with speaker notes, and prepares Q&A.

## When to use

`present-paper` activates on requests such as: present paper, paper presentation, journal club, seminar presentation, grand rounds, academic presentation, presentation prep, lecture, lecture material, teaching slides, course slides, 강의자료, 발표자료, 슬라이드, pptx.

## Quality Card

**Purpose** — Turn source papers into an audience-adapted deck with speaker notes, Mac-compatible PPTX, and a sharing-stripped variant.

**Safety boundaries**

- Slide claims trace to the source material; findings are not invented for narrative effect.
- A notes-stripped variant is produced for sharing so private speaker notes never leak.

**Known limitations**

- Figure cropping and notes parsing are heuristic; verify the built PPTX in PowerPoint.
- Overflow is measured from a rendered PDF, so it needs one: without a render the check exits 2 rather than reporting a pass.
- Font portability is a blocklist of platform-bundled faces. A font absent from it may still be missing at the venue; embedding, or a PDF, is the only guarantee.
- A per-slide script is required, not a topic. Given only a topic, the deck comes out generic in the way every reviewer can see -- the skill asks for the narrative instead of inventing one.
- It does not draw diagrams from autoshapes: flows and mechanisms are rendered as code (matplotlib / Graphviz) and inserted, because an unlabelled arrow is read differently by every person in the room.
- The Nature/Lancet defaults target academic profiles; larger-type venues need adaptation. Capacity limits do not guarantee text fit or acceptable density.
- Mac OOXML quirks require the bundled compatibility checks; not every host renders identically.

**Validation**

- `unzip the .pptx and confirm 0 markdown-raw notes / 0 TIFF / app.xml counts synced`
- `python3 scripts/check_slide_tells.py output/presentation.pptx --strict`
- `python3 scripts/check_deck_budget.py output/presentation.pptx --archetype <venue> --minutes <N> --strict`
- `python3 scripts/check_font_portability.py output/presentation.pptx --strict`
- `python3 scripts/check_diagram_edges.py diagrams/ --strict`
- `python3 scripts/check_text_overflow.py output/presentation.pptx --pdf output/presentation.pdf --strict`
- `bash scripts/check_slide_tells_challenge/verify.sh`
- `bash scripts/check_deck_budget_challenge/verify.sh`
- `bash scripts/check_font_portability_challenge/verify.sh`
- `bash scripts/check_diagram_edges_challenge/verify.sh`
- `bash scripts/check_text_overflow_challenge/verify.sh`
- `python3 tests/test_overflow_pdf.py`
- `python3 tests/test_builder_layout.py`
- `python3 scripts/strip_notes_for_sharing.py before sharing`
