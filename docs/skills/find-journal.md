# find-journal

> Journal recommendation engine for medical manuscripts. 2-pass matching against a curated public profile library plus any user-local private profiles, enriched with detailed write-paper profiles for top-5 output. Returns ranked recommendations with scope fit rationale, AI disclosure policy, and homepage links. Impact-factor and APC figures in a profile are point-in-time and may be stale — verify current metrics at the journal site. A pre-ranking acceptance-readiness pre-flight scans the manuscript for design-ceiling, unfixable-defect, and importance-risk signals to add an acceptance-feasibility axis alongside scope fit, and the output includes a reject-fallback cascade plan.

## When to use

`find-journal` activates on requests such as: find journal, recommend journal, where to submit, which journal, journal selection, target journal, journal match.

## Quality Card

**Purpose** — Rank candidate journals by scope fit from the curated profile library, with AI-disclosure policy and homepage links.

**Safety boundaries**

- No cached impact-factor/APC values are asserted; users verify current metrics at journal sites.
- Recommendations are drawn from the curated profile library, not invented venues.

**Known limitations**

- Coverage is limited to profiled journals; an unprofiled fit may be missed (add via add-journal).
- Both axes (scope fit and acceptance feasibility) are advisory; the feasibility band is a risk/ceiling estimate with reasons, never an acceptance probability.
- The Phase 2.5 pre-flight is a lexical/heuristic scan; it surfaces signals to weigh, not a verdict, and its flags are not auto-fixable.

**Validation**

- `python3 scripts/assess_acceptance_readiness.py <manuscript_or_abstract.md>`
- `bash scripts/acceptance_readiness_challenge/verify.sh  # deterministic, network-free`
- `verify shortlisted journals' current scope and metrics at their official sites`

**Evidence** — `manual_workflow`
