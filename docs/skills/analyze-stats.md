# analyze-stats

> Statistical analysis for medical research papers. Generates reproducible Python/R code with publication-ready tables and figures. Supports diagnostic accuracy, inter-rater agreement, meta-analysis, survival analysis, survey data, group comparisons, regression, propensity score, and repeated measures.

**Invoke:** `/analyze-stats` · **Tools:** Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob · **Model:** inherit

## Quality Card

**Purpose** — Produce reproducible statistical code and publication-ready output for a specified design (DTA, agreement, survival, regression, survey, etc.).

**Safety boundaries**

- All numbers come from executed code on the supplied data; never hand-typed (seed-fixed transforms).
- Primary estimates report 95% CIs; planned hypothesis tests also report effect sizes and exact p-values.

**Known limitations**

- Correctness depends on a correct analysis plan and clean data (use design-study / clean-data first).
- Does not adjudicate clinical validity of the chosen test.
- The bound binary workflow requires declared independent units and fixed 0/1 predictions; hashes do not establish design validity or data rights.

**Validation**

- `python3 tests/test_analysis_run.py`
- `python3 scripts/demo_analysis_run.py --out demo-project`
- `re-run the emitted script and diff results`
- `/self-review`

**Evidence** — `demo`
